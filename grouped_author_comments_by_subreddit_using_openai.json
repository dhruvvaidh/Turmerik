Rebyota is the only other FDA approved option but meaningfully inferior- 150mL enema of donor fecal matter, 70.6% recurrence free @ 8wks vs 3-day oral regimen, 88% recurrence free @ 8wks for Vowst. VE303 is a 14-day course vs Vowst's 3-day course. Efficacy is unlikely to be meaningfully different (possibly worse- 13.8% recurrence for VE303 in Ph2 vs 12.4% for Vowst). Neither docs nor patients will care much about donor derived spores vs defined consortium distinction given Vowst's safety profile. Even if VE303 gets approved, it'll be 4-5yrs minimum before it gets through Ph3, approval and payer review process, when Vowst will be nearing peak sales. Ferring, Finch, Takeda have discontinued dev of their oral candidates for rCDI for good reason (ie Vowst), Vedanta will burn cash and not have much of rCDI market left by approval. Pfizer's C diff vaccine failed. Merck's Zinplava is barely more effective than placebo. FDA is phasing out FMT. Vowst is basically the only credible option for rCDI and will remain so until (maybe) VE303 gets approved, but by then Vedanta will be too late.",

Nestle can easily justify $2B+ acquisition for Seres based on $700m peak sales potential, but given size of market 156k rCDI, broadest possible label, $17.5k treatment course and limited competition, Seres is easily worth more than $2B."

In real life if you work in NGO, you probably need to know more about politics and marketing than MPH in order to appeal for funding. I lost interests when my health policy course started off with what is universal health care. I was like, I paid my tuition to learn some hard skills instead of having some philosophical debate. I ranted about it in the course review by using harsh words. \n\nOh back to the topic, because I have a bachelor in pharmacy and I don't wanna be a pharmacist. Working in clinical research gives me a sense of project management. It has a sense of continuity as opposed to dealing one prescription after another.

Aside from the psychological reward, the money is really good after 3 years in the industry and you get to get 25% of increase every two years when you transfer to another company. Even in APAC (specifically South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan) the money is considered much higher than the local average. The money might be not so appealing in a developed country like US, Canada or Australia though.  I would say as long as you are ok with the duress and pressure it is a nice career but in the long run please seek for a project manager role for the sake of your health.

It\u2019s great for the relationship and doesn\u2019t require a lot of phone calls and emails to make it through.",
                "Congrats!\n\nThings I would have appreciated hearing when I got started as a CRA:\n\n - You cannot do the work of the site. Once you do, they come to expect it indefinitely from both you and their other CRAs. As a PM, you probably know that. \n- You are not responsible for the site\u2019s actions. If the site disregarded your directions in favor of their own, it\u2019s not your fault. Your duty is to remind them what\u2019s expected, document the issue, and send positive energy their way whenever possible. \n- For every problem, there\u2019s a solution. There\u2019s nothing you\u2019re coming across as a CRA that can\u2019t be handled. Lean on your colleagues, LMs, and CLMs to get you on the right path. There\u2019s no shame in not knowing how to handle broken things. Many CRAs come from sites where you followed the protocols, manuals, etc and reported everything appropriately - that\u2019s not a typical site.  \n- Don\u2019t kill yourself for the company. They will have you flying to four cities a week, completing multiple visits a day, and even after you\u2019ve been up until 4am completing reports ask you why you spent $2 in office supplies. Don\u2019t ask me how I know. Take your FTO, take an extra night in a hotel if you need it, and know what inches you closer to burnout. Be open with your manager about it so they can shield you from additional obligations while you regenerate the desire to work there. \n- Stay loyal to the same brand(s). This means always renting from the same rental car company, staying in the same hotel chain, and maximizing your unreported income (loyalty programs) as much as possible. There\u2019s something nice about bringing your parents/partner/family somewhere and having the ability to make their trip better than it\u2019s ever been before or would have been without you. \n- Invest your or your company\u2019s money into lounge access. You\u2019ll spend a lot of time in an airport and having access to a standard set of snacks and drinks when you arrive ultimately saves you and your company time and money. The platinum card from American Express or the Sapphire card from Chase may be a worthy investment if you\u2019re stateside. \n- Spend your stipend unless it comes back in cash. Even if I don\u2019t have the will to spend the money on myself, I\u2019ll always make sure to use that money to give food to a less fortunate soul, provide an amazing tip, or even to bring snacks back home. If you don\u2019t spend it, it simply stays in the hands of the sponsor. \n- Buy yourself a nice set of luggage and laptop bags to make it through. You\u2019ll be running through airports, sites, and hotels - a bag failure while you\u2019re traveling can have some pretty detrimental effects for your day and can even leak into your visit. Some companies have stipends for this. \n- Take time during your trips for you. If you spend an entire day/night working for the man and you don\u2019t stop to grab that overpriced coffee, dinner at that cafe you always wanted to go to, or walk around like a tourist in a cool city - you\u2019ll become jaded like many of us here. \n- On site relations, read about what sites complain about here and really hear them out. Some CRAs have hella high expectations and some barely show up. Your job isn\u2019t to give them the answers they want in the time they want it but instead to provide the right answers and to set expectations (for yourself and the site). \n- Harass them as little as possible and make sure they know that you believe in them. Remember, YOU are the one with the relationship with the site and the sponsor may not have your back when they say that you\u2019re \u201caggressively\u201d just doing your job. You do not deserve to be treated with indignity from the site. If something traumatic happens, you have a right to request a new site. \n- Lastly, stay organized! If you can\u2019t give someone a rundown of your site in 3 minutes or less, it may be concerning. Work on your eTMF filings weekly, utilize your CTA, and take pride in your ability to translate from whatever-the-fuck-nonsense-query they just got from DM into language they can actually understand. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s what I would have written to myself. I hope it\u2019s helpful.",

The solution they showed me was that I just needed to \u201canchor\u201d my hand/needle better when swapping. Making sure there was a firmer contact between the back of my hand holding the needle and the person\u2019s arm made it much easier to keep the needle rock solid while swapping tubes.

I mostly had great CRAs, who I have combined their styles with my own. We are all human, we are all expected to do our jobs (frequently by people who don\u2019t understand), and we all can make mistakes.

No we are not because you expect us to know over sponsor 100 trainings (SOPs, WIs, GUIDs, ppts, etc) 1/4 of which have 30+ pages and/or slides. Fast forward to a few months later and I\u2019m cleaning up the leftover mess of 6 sites for a study in maintenance OLE and another study in recruitment - I have 7 sites mostly SQV, 1 pending SIV, and someone handed their one site to me which has already screen 4 patients in 1 month and their data entry and labs are a mess.

Since I started, I realized I will only hold myself to the standards of patient safety, regulatory requirements, quality, WLB, and knowing that as a human one can only do so much and are fallible, so owning your accountability. The best way I\u2019ve found to smooth things over is just to be very cordial in a way which acknowledges that the overwork doesn\u2019t just effect any one specific CR role.

                "It is generally fine to complete it before the SIV, but the potential issue I see with a lot of sites is their DOA or SOP states that by signing they or the PI are attesting that you're trained. If you can't complete it because you're not trained yet then the sponsor should understand that you need to abide by your SOP. Really they just want to get ahead and make sure you're ready to hit the ground running because DOA logs are one of those things that a lot of sites take FUCKING FOREVER to figure out after SIV then run into issues with someone working on the study before they are delegated.  \n\nMy recommendation if you can't have everyone sign it is that you just list everyone's names, roles and tasks, and just hold off on the start date and signature until the SIV. The start date can even maybe be before the SIV. This will give your CRA and sponsor contacts a lot of confidence that it's at least being worked on.  \n\nThey also REALLY want to know who will be delegated so they can associate them with the correct site and roles in the CTMS and get access to systems set up before the SIV.",
                "This is the main reason they want it. Also sites tend to weirdly drag their feet sometimes on getting the DOA set up after SIV and it causes all sorts of headaches. If it's mostly done before the SIV it usually gets signed and dated by everyone needed a lot faster after.",

They delegate them when they delegate them and people date the day they signed. There is no issue in principle with delegating before the SIV. The delegation log is not inherently tied to the SIV which is why it's fine to delegate after the SIV also.  \n\nAgain, please describe what exactly this \"finding\" would be?",
                "Sites train themselves all the time. Literally you just need to review the materials yourself. You don't do a whole SIV every time someone new is delegated. SIV training is something that  sponsors are required to do at an SIV but not all staff need to be trained during an SIV or by the sponsor on that day. By signing a delegation log to the are NOT saying you were trained at the SIV. That's not what the delegation log is for.  \n\nIt seems like you've seen this done one certain way and are assuming that it's done the same way everywhere.",
                "What do they sign at an SIV? A training log. Falsifying study data? Friend, the delegation log is not study data. Nor is a training log. Falsifying study data is something entirely different and involving the data being collected on study subjects. Not regulatory documents.\n\nWhat exactly do you think a delegation log is? Because it sounds like you are confusing it with training documentation. Delegation log has nothing to do with an SIV other than I usually makes sense to complete it at the SIV. The delegation log is not necessarily where SIV training is documented and it is frequently documented separately because not everyone joins the SIV and some are trained and delegated later. There is no falsifying happening if nobody is claiming to be trained when they were not. \n\nI have seen far more delegation logs signatures with dates before or after SIV, and these documents have been seen by countless people and been through audits and inspections and nobody has said anything because there is no issue with the PI delegating someone before or after the SIV.\n\nRespectfully, please stop talking out your ass and open yourself up to being wrong and learning new things.",

It took a car accident on my way back to work (at night after hours! Because I forgot to do something) to realize work was not worth my health anymore. \n\nI was lead on many concurrent highly enrolling studies with >150 active subjects at any time. My monitors were supportive, and saw I was drowning despite my best efforts- unable to meet all 24 hour entry deadlines, address all action items. Even they recommended I discuss with the PI to slow enrollment down. My PI\u2019s and manager unfortunately were not the most receptive to this, and only after breaking my arm when I was physically unable to see patients, did they decide to stop enrolling on those studies.\n\nAt this point without a raise in years and sacrificing my health, I am also ready to leave the site. I\u2019m proud of the work I\u2019ve done to get these drugs approved but I am SO ready to pass on the torch.\n\nHappy friday and I hope better opportunities come for you.

My previous CRO counted remote visits as .3 of a visit and my current cro counts them as a full day but keeps calling them 'easy days' which is just killing my soul, because they are just as much effort as onsite days.\n\n\nWith my small sites, I don't mind building the relationship with the PIs, but most of the time the PIs I've interacted with at these large academic centers just want the CRAs to be efficient and communicative.\u00a0",

And we are actually delivering a practical, solid solution to a problem whereas a lot of public health initiatives don\u2019t actually do anything.",

And it\u2019s not effective and is condescending lol",

But I work at an academic health center/university and I think that is the only type of organization it would help me at. When I\u2019ve looked at industry jobs they truly do not care at all about an MPH. And making the jump from site level to industry is tough. Experience really is the most valuable thing in clinical research. My recommendation would be to get a CRC job and be curious and take on new tasks and projects when you can to improve your breadth of knowledge. I took the CCRP exam which I think is good and helps set a base of knowledge about regulations.",

                "I believe sponsor does not provide source worksheets in recent years due to compliance issue. CRF, eCRF, paper source document, EPIC are all in the scope of source documents in clinical trials if you look up FDA guidance. For the sake of the argument, a piece of paper or sticky note with trial information is part of source doc. When paper records were scanned into an electronic system, say EPIC, the record in EPIC becomes certified record, thus original paper copies can be disposed. For example, does your trial have lab sample acquisition forms? That is the paper source and needed to be scanned for you to monitor electronically.\n\nFor your original question, it has to be a risk based assessment. What you are able to do remotely can only be part of sponsor (or CRO delegated) oversight responsibilities. Does your trial utilize central/risk monitoring model? How do you monitor your IP accountability beyond what recorded in Vestigo? Does your trial use Class II drug which you have to conduct drug return verification, i.e. pill counts? How do you know if your drug stored properly?\n\nAgree with you on that, remote monitoring does not mean less workload for monitoring activities.\n\nIf you keep up with current thinking or Q&A session from FDA BIMO folks via public forum, fully remote is not being endorsed but onus is on sponsor to mitigate risks. Furthermore, if you have been to a FDA inspection, this would be questioned by inspector if your monitoring plan does not support fully remote or have justification for fully or most remote visits. Don't ask me how I know :)."

I was a CTA for 3 years so I had SSU experience already and it was an easy switch. SSU is mostly about collecting regulatory documents (1572, IRB approval, CVs, etc.), help the site to customize informed consent, and negotiate budget/CTA. Contract specialist is the one to negotiate CTA/budget so you probably don't need to worry about that.\n\nMy advice would be get good at organizing documents & site communications, and track each site's status. If your organization skill is good, SSU for the most part is very easy work. But when the planned activation date is near, the study team will be all over you and it will be super stressful since SSU is all about meeting that activation deadline. The best part about SSU is that you can actually get the work done and move on. We activate the site and hand over to the CRAs. I aint worrying about the site after they get activated."

                "Honestly, I think the thing that many sites and even some CRAs/Sponsor Staff don\u2019t understand is that protocol deviations are not automatically a horrible thing, or something to take personally. \n\nThey literally exist to identify where the data didn\u2019t follow the stated protocol, which is important. Because your handing a huge protocol to regulators, scientists, physicians and other people that care about your data and you\u2019re saying \u201cwe ran this study on x number of subjects based on these exact parameters\u201d and protocol deviations are how you identify anywhere and everywhere those exact parameters weren\u2019t true. \n\nWhich is a very important part of the scientific method for many reasons, but mainly for reproducibility of results. \n\nAny study involving real people is going to have deviations. In fact, it\u2019s a huge red flag if it doesn\u2019t. And yes, sites and sponsors both have to try and follow the protocol to the best of their ability, but shit happens. The important part is documenting what happened and why, and periodically reviewing to see if there are trends that are occurring that indicate poor procedures at the site, a poorly devised protocol, bad vendor processes, etc.\n\nJust like we expect sites to identify deviations and take corrective and preventative measures for significant or repeated issues, regulators also hold sponsors accountable if there are widespread deviations that indicate study procedures aren\u2019t able to be followed by sites, and the sponsor did nothing to address the issue. \n\nI get push back nearly everyday from sites when they get a deviation because a subject was out of town and didn\u2019t do their visit in window, or they couldn\u2019t collect a PK in time because the subjects veins were bad and they couldn\u2019t get a stick, or other similar things. They feel like \u201cwell it\u2019s not our fault, so it\u2019s not a deviation\u201d. But that\u2019s not how deviations work. They simply indicate where the protocol was not followed, regardless of fault. \n\nYou discuss fault when you take and document corrective and preventative actions, which you cannot do if you don\u2019t address that there was a deviation in the first place. \n\nIt really is so refreshing when people understand the purpose of deviations is not to \u201ctell on you\u201d or \u201cmake you look bad\u201d or any number of other things that I\u2019ve heard people say in response to being issued a very clear deviation. \n\nSites that identify and document when a deviation occurs, and take quick corrective and preventative actions to address them are worth their weight in gold and also seem to have much happier, less stressed out staff.",
                "I totally get that part completely. I was a CRC for many years and had to deal with hospital staff that had the same apathy towards research. \n\nIt\u2019s why I personally find hospital sites to not be desirable if you can avoid using them on your study. The staff is too large, too busy, and the PIs often don\u2019t do their job of ensuring appropriate oversight (although that part happens at most sites these days it seems).",
                "Yeah, the ICF one happens a lot and is down to CRAs and other clin ops people just not understanding how things work at all. Some of them just look at the IRB approval date and compare that to the date of study visits, not realizing that they have to look at the IRB approval letter date instead, and even then there\u2019s a level of common sense required. \n\nBut this is why many sites have an SOP that outlines the process for implementing amended ICFs. It does protect them from these types of unnecessary PDs. Sites that have experience under their belt will have an SOP that says something like \u201cUpon receipt of IRB-approved ICF, the consent will be distributed to the PI and study team by regulatory coordinator and the staff will have up to 2 business days to review the consent for training purposes, before it is implemented at the site and used to consent/re-consent study subjects.\u201d These sites will also have a consent log or other documentation that shows \u201cdate of implementation\u201d of the consent, and that should be the date it was truly distributed and ready to be used to consent study subjects.",
                "That\u2019s why I said \u201cif you can avoid using them on your study\u201d. I agree a lot of protocols are poorly written but a lot of the things that were mentioned in regards to hospital staff not wanting to follow a protocol aren\u2019t going to be fixed by writing better protocols. \n\nEvery country/hospital/clinical team/Investigator has their own standard of care for certain processes, so it\u2019s not possible to write a protocol that fits what the clinical staff does in normal practice and you have to have standard procedures across sites for many things in a clinical trial. \n\nSo the issues expressed with the hospital staff aren\u2019t ever going to be addressed just by writing better protocols. They have to be addressed by insisting that clinical staff that do any study procedures understand the importance of and reasons for following the protocol and  research admin teams building a culture of compliance from the clinical staff. \n\nIt\u2019s actually pretty wild how much each site varies in what they want in a protocol. Every SIV, I have sites that say \u201cthat\u2019s stupid why would they do it like that\u201d only for the next SIV with the next site to have them say \u201cfinally, I\u2019m so glad you guys require it like that because that\u2019s how we do it\u201d.

                "Yeah, then I think you\u2019ll be fine. A lot of times the monitor just has to push back with info and then the team in charge of deviations can just be slow to make a final decision. A lot of studies only do PD review meetings quarterly, so that\u2019s when they will likely get all the shareholders together, present the background info and get their OK to remove it.",
                "But it does impact the data, that\u2019s just it\u2026 when you have a protocol that\u2019s been approved by the regulators and IRB it has to be followed. End of. Any half decent investigator should understand that. \n\nIf investigators don\u2019t like a protocol, they should refuse to do the study. Federal regulations, GCP, the contract they sign, and the 1572 they sign all say that they will follow the protocol as written, except in very specific circumstances to protect subjects. \n\nThey have no right to not follow the protocol because they don\u2019t think it impacts the data. It very much does. \n\nYou brought the problem up, and it is a real problem. A lot of staff that straddle both worlds (clinical and research) seem to have very poor understanding of how research actually works and the consequences of their actions. They also tend to value clinical work much higher, which means research often gets put on the back burner, deprioritized, or requirements are treated more like suggestions. \n\nNot following the protocol has a very detrimental impact on the data. Data is often thrown out because the protocol was not followed. Regulators and sponsors take it very seriously. Investigators can be blacklisted, lose their license, even be jailed (in extreme cases of blatant fraud). \n\nI will repeat again: I agree that many, if not most, protocols are poorly written and sponsors must do better. But the way to handle that as an investigator/site is to vet studies well during feasibility and startup and refuse to take on studies that you know you can\u2019t be compliant with.\n\nNumber 1 because investigators/sites are required to follow the protocol by law and by contract and the consequences to themselves and to the sponsor are very bad when they don\u2019t and Number 2 because the most effective way to get sponsors to write better protocols is when they can\u2019t find any sites to take their studies because their protocols are shit.",
                "Highly recommend using the resources from the Society of Clinical Research Sites (SCRS). They have amazing courses to introduce research naive investigators and coordinators to clinical research concepts. \n\nAs a side note, they have a great conference they do each year that is a great way for sites to learn great info/tips and network with companies and other sites.\n\nETA: here\u2019s the link to the training modules from SCRS website.\n\nhttps://myscrs.org/learning-campus/site-management-modules/\n\nAdditionally, I believe it\u2019s USC has a program for regulatory science or something similar, and they have some great online trainings related to that program."

I applied to dozens of those jobs and talked to anyone I could get (on the phone or even traveling to meet in person) with no luck for 6 months. Desperate to do something, I accepted an interview to work in oncology trails at a local hospital. The pay and hours were awful, but I learned a lot and worked with several CROs and Sponsors. From there, it was easy to propel into a role with them for much higher pay. Why not?\n\nThere\u2019s limitless opportunity in CR. It\u2019s not a perfect industry, but I was able to apply my skills and quickly work my way up. The MPH definitely helped get me interviews and more senior positions with higher starting salaries. Do you need one? Certainly not- One of my favorite coworkers has a BS in English but started on the bottom and worked her way up to where she is now. As with any industry, your degree just sets your starting point. \n\nHope this helps- good luck!"

                "Hi, I was an external candidate recommended by a GSK employee for a Lead level role. The entire process from application to the job offer took approx. a month. There were 3 calls in total: one with HR, one with the hiring director and a panel interview when I presented an excercise I was given. The excercise was quite complex so I needed about a week to complete it and put together a decent presentation. Other than that, the entire process went smoothly, they didn\u2019t mind adjusting to my schedule when planning the interviews and provided their feedback right after the calls. \n\nThe only caviat here is that they urgently needed to fill in the role as I was told by the person who recommended me. The job posting was up for quite some time when I applied. \n\nGood luck with your interview!",
                "As an ex drug safety worker, I say go with the patient recruitment. When you think about it from the company perspective, patient recruitment is worth the investment as it means faster enrolment and shorter trials. Time = money. Safety is important but largly due to the regulatory requirements. It doesn\u2019t impact study timelines so they\u2019re always going to put just enough money in it to keep it running. Also I\u2019ve always felt as if safety was completely separated from everything that was happening in the study; once I moved to the other department I learned so much more than when I was stuck in my little safety world.",
                "Sorry to hear you are experiencing a burnout. Perhaps your company offers a shadowing program with other roles or part-time assignments in other departments? I have done these in the past and they\u2019re a great way to learn about different career paths in the clinical research.\n\nIf you are good in critical thinking and pay strong attention to detail, risk-based central monitoring may be a good match for you. The knowlege of site processes is a huge advantage there and I know many former site monitors who grew tired of constant travelling and were very happy once they moved to central monitoring. This position usually does not require direct contact with the sites but rather the central study team. Other roles where prior site monitoring experience may be an advantage are with site identification, biomarkers, study supplies or patient engagement teams. \n\nAnother thing (and I\u2019m speaking from my experience - not as a site monitor though), work for Sponsors has always been more rewarding and better organized than for any CRO I have ever worked with, especially when it comes to the workload and timelines. Look for openings at your Sponsor companies. \n\nClinical research is a huge industry with plenty of opportunities for people with the experience and it sounds like you\u2019ve got plenty. I\u2019m sure you will find your perfect match soon \u2764\ufe0f"

I switched to a CRO in my late 30s and while it definitely isn\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s so much better than before. Public health, whether academic or public, is often driven by funding and doesn\u2019t allow for creative approaches or new voices (often). In academia, we cultured unique voices to speak up and be heard as students, only to put them in a vice when they graduate that their jobs are constantly on the chopping block from budget guts or missed grant funding. I also hated how mediocrity was celebrated - so many people only cared about publishing for their resumes or to get their name mentioned on regional calls. No one thought about actually making changes.\n\nCall it what you will, but at least there is a better mission in clinical research and a lot firmer goal than either of those 2 arenas in which I worked.",

Always. This was the first time that it was announced via a separate bonus that was ambiguous and not clearly shown as helping them enforce WFH compliance.\n\nI have no problem with people getting fired that didn\u2019t adhere by the policy. The company hired you, not your manager, so I would rely on what the company says, not your manager regarding policies like this. However, having it be a bonus, right after the CEO mentions that bonuses are lower for various reasons seems incredibly strange and vaguely motivated by more than boosting stock prices by highlighting efficiency because the end of the quarter.\n\nIn academia, standard practice and what was adhered to was actually more enforceable than our collective bargaining contract.

There are numerous policies that could impact bonuses, like phishing test failures and completing exams/signing off on SOPs, but they are clearly communicated by day 1.\n\nForget about people who were fired. There is a WFH bank in-office people get, and without any notification or warning, people got an extra bonus for not using up a given benefit.

I'm hoping to start one of our new studies that way towards the end of the year and I'm super excited. \n\nMy concern would be first about SOPs for your build and validation process, and also how you describe it in the DMP. (But I also was part of a NDA submission team and had to do inspection readiness at my last co.) I won't let us start building in-house until we update our SOPs (which right now cover our sponsor oversight). If you have that all well in hand, though, feel free to ignore.\n\nThe other thing I'd encourage you to consider with template creation like this is at a small company you have more stakeholders than just other DM & programming -- so making any of your documents / mock ups as non-DM reader friendly as you can.  What you are describing sounds great and captures the big stuff, but a medical monitor or CTM is probably going to want to see all the available options for a proposed drop down on the CRF tab, not have to go looking for the code list elsewhere.",

They just create a ton of templates for everything, including query language.

If you have to review that much, of course things are going to get missed, and it is much more likely that something important will be. This was a topic at the regulatory townhall at SCDM last year.\n\nI found out last year that for one of my oncology studies, the CRO had been doing manual SAE reconciliation monthly. This was a Phase 1/2 study that had been ongoing for 4 years. The DM told me it was taking the data team 24 hours each month to review, when in reality we were getting on average maybe 1 new SAE reported a month at that point. When I asked why they didn't program, it was crickets. (We were having a meeting about the recon because critical things were being missed.)",

So many VAS.

We don't have a single nurse as clinical scientist without them having terminal degree. Mostly we have pharmd or phds, or those with masters who grandfathered due to 10-20 years of experience. \nIn my old hospital, CRNs typically are paid more than CRCs, but not that much more. For ex. When I was without RN, I was making 90K, once I got my license my salary increased to 100K. But it could have increased without the licence as well, just purely from experience stand point. So if staying  within the academia or hospital setting, evaluate what you want to do in 5 years, still be coordinating or move up to management or switch to pharma. In any case, I don't think MSN will be worth unless you advance to NP down the road. But if you see yourself coordinating for the next 5-10 years, maybe it will be worth it money wise. And of course you will have invaluable  medical knowledge."

I think the biggest issue is PIs who want to open all the studies offered to them so they can either help all their patients, gain prestige, both or building relationships with all sponsors. They refuse to turn down studies and research management is afraid to tell them they need to. The end result is an understaffed, burntout research team and constant turnover. I\u2019ve only worked in two roles where this wasn\u2019t a problem. One of which is my current role where I have a great relationship with the PIs and they listen to me when I tell them our team of coordinators are overworked or if we need to place a hold on enrollment for a little bit. The main PI will openly tell CROs and Sponsors if we need to slow down enrollment or that we don\u2019t have the staff to open a new study for a while.",

                "I have been personally impressed with most of the ex-US colleagues that I have worked with, but most of these are at the clinops management level, so the view may be skewed.  The Business Ops/Finance interactions I have had with Ex-US teams have been more challenging.\n\nHowever, I will say that there are a couple of variables that I believe directly affect the quality of these newly outsourced teams and are not simply just the geography:\n\n1. Companies are laying folks off before or concurrently with the hiring of these outsourced teams.  This gets rid of many resources that could effectively train these new teams, and instead, they get left without proper training.\n\n2. Timezones: A Geography based issue, but also half-due to industry processes.  On the Business Ops side at least, we have deliverable deadlines, and those deliverables require (typically) multiple levels and/or rounds of review.  This means if an Ex-US resource/team is assigned on the deliverables, it could take up to twice as long since issues cannot be resolved throughout the day with active feedback, assuming US reviewers. Additionally, the timezones affect attendance for meetings which causes a lack of alignment at times. Some Ex-US resources work abnormal hours to account for this, but not all. \n\n3. Management: if an Ex-US team has US management/leadership, then the 2 above issues are amplified\n\n4. Language barrier, as others have stated, but this is becoming less and less of an issue.\n\n5. Intra-Industry Movement - This is more speculation, but I believe it will become an issue over time. One of the biggest benefits of this industry is the fluidity of its workforce, a benefit for both employers and employees.  With outsourcing increasing, this increases competition in the labor force and could make it more difficult to land a job at a competitor since equally qualified, cheaper resources, potentially with less tenure in the industry, can be hired.  Specific to the employers, this could stifle the flow of information, experiences, lessons from failures, new processes, new efficiencies, etc from company to company.\n\nJust my thoughts/observations.  Do I think it\u2019s a death sentence to companies that outsource? No.  However, the consequences of the decision to do so will be felt further down the line, and I do not believe it will be worth the cost-savings being experienced currently.",

If you have experience as a finance analyst, in FP&A, etc. it\u2019s about the same as landing a similar role anywhere else.\n\nIf you have experience in the industry (finance, clinops, or otherwise), you will be at quite the advantage since you know the tasks being budgeted and have a general idea of the effort that will go into the tasks being budgeted.\n\nThe title or structure of these roles is different at every company.  On the CRO side, some may have \u201cCommercial Finance Analysts\u201d or \u201cBusiness Analysts\u201d that handle budgets, proposals, contracts, or some mixture of those.  Others may be more specific and have Bidders, Proposal Analysts, Contract Analysts, etc. that will handle clinical trial budgets, but at different stages of the process. \n\nBiggest tips on landing a role are:\n\n1.Be solid in Excel (XLookup, pivot tables, If formulas, etc) and have a good understanding of how to calculate things like gross margin. \n\n2. Have Knowledge of different billing types and budget structures such as unitized, time and materials, milestone-based, etc.\n\n3. Have the ability to draft contractual language if your role will also handle any contract documents\n\n4. Have good answers for when you get asked about your ability to communicate with clients/executives and your time management skills.  Time management will be a hot topic because these roles have lots of tight turnaround times and strict deadlines.\n\n5. Get an internal referral. Unless being headhunted, I\u2019m not hearing much, if any, success with just applying.  A referral that gets you in touch with a recruiter is crucial.\n\nHope some of this info helps.  I can go into more details on anything if needed.",

Them and several other CROs are outsourcing as many of those types of roles as possible because it is \u201ceasy\u201d cost savings.\n\nQuite frankly, I have not heard of clinops layoffs here or otherwise that are as large as the layoffs in other functions."

They refused to pay for holidays that Actalent didn\u2019t recognize but for which my hospital was closed (MLK, Juneteenth).\n\nI came on for a one-year contract with the expectation that if the hospital wanted to bring me on, they could. Management came about 7 months in to learn what in the heck we all did because they had no earthly idea. They took us out to dinner and gave us a sales pitch on why we should stay with Actalent long-term.\n\nThen, in the 9th month, they randomly extended my contract without telling me. I had screenshots of the original date in their app because I had sinking feeling they\u2019d try something like this. I raised hell, got both my site and Actalent managers involved, and got the contract changed back. I expressed my dissatisfaction with Actalent and they didn\u2019t really have much in the way of an argument in favor of them.\n\nMy contract ended on 10/4 of last year because I fought to get it back to its original 1 year, and I was hired full-time by the hospital on 10/5 (as was planned). I got a roughly $10k raise when I transitioned. On 10/15, my hospital initiated a hiring freeze that\u2019s still in effect and terminated all employment agency contracts and all temp employees were laid off a month later (not Actalent\u2019s fault, but a reminder of how fragile contract work is). In essence, I missed being part of that layoff by less than 2 weeks.\n\nMoral of the story: I had a bad experience with Actalent. Others may have done better, so hopefully lots of people chime in, but I personally do not recommend them. Try to find a role without them if you can, and if you do pursue contract work in an entry-level role, look for agencies that don\u2019t make you sign one-year contracts.",

                "The first mass offshore move of DM and to some degree biostats programming happened in 2004 (Quintiles leading the pack - retained the leads in the west with all support and programming going East). Over the next few years the trend spread to the other big CROs. Big Pharma mostly appreciated the cost cutting while mid and small don\u2019t trust the quality, driving *some* biometrics business to the next CRO tier. Quality in India slowly improved over the next decade, but then two things happened: 1. Labor costs in India were rising making the savings not as substantial and 2. Even big pharma started asking for NAm/EU biometrics again. Big CRO slowly started growing their Western biometrics staff again. Now the pendulum is swinging East again. The quality out of India is generally pretty good now BUT the higher attrition rates and timezone differences can and do cause some delays and communication problems. Give it 5 years or so and the pendulum will likely swing West again, but by then, the industry won\u2019t have trained up the staff to meet the need, so people will be harder to find.\n\nTo answer your question, in spite of people loving to say it will be a disaster, the truth is it\u2019ll be \u201cmeh\u201d. The research results will be no different\u2026 and it\u2019ll introduce one more possible delay risk that mixes in with a million other delay risks that all together are the reasons 85% of clinical trials run late to their original timelines (that\u2019s a whole discussion unto itself that I\u2019ll leave alone).\n\nAll that said, I do recommend getting out of DM.

He said the patient\u2019s actions were reasonable because it was a very sick population and they have the right to tend to, or enjoy quality of life moments, and there was no cause for concern because the 5% staff errors weren\u2019t anything that put patients at risk, just minor reminders with no need for formal re-training. \nRecently in my mom\u2019s saved papers I found a letter from this doctor to my mom, a condolence letter when my dad passed away in the mid-90\u2019s.

Most of our newer studies used their own company-specific EDC systems (smaller sponsors/pharma clients). It was a pain to remember logins for everything, but most were very user-friendly. \n\nAs a former CRC at a large academic center & former CRA for a global sponsor mainly responsible for academic centers, I\u2019ve NEVER witnessed anyone turn down participation based on the EDC system.

                "What did you hear? :)  So far in my country what I observed is as follows.  \n  \nCutting corner practice.  \n- PI not signing the source worksheets in time but later after CRA spot the missing signatures  \n- PI not recording AEs on EMR but rather use paper-based worksheets as source documents, making it easier to edit the source data (also means he or she was not serious on AEs when assessing the patients  \n- Having a diagnosis only because the drug needs to be under health insurance coverage but then no documentation exists to say \"this is only for the insurance purpose, the patient doesn't actually have stomach ulcer\" As for why then the doctor prescribe it? because he thought NSAID will be hard on stomach lining. \n\nUnderstanding GCP but not implement it or ignore it\n\n- Study coordinator (research nurse) being more familar with the criteria than PI or simply call CRA whenever they want to know something about the protocol.  \n- PI not wanting to meet CRA because we are not medical rep who would bring coffee or sushi bento box to him. We ended up creating an issue on MV report every 2 visits and every resolution will be \"we will follow up with letter or give him a call\". Common scenario is you won't see PI within 6 months.   \n- Sponsor or CRO hired start up specialists creating IRB submission packages for PI. There's no law saying you couldn't hire someone to do things for PI but we still write \"PI is preparing for the new protocol submission to IRB with the assistance of start up specialists\" in MV report. :) Schizophrenic much right?  \n- CRA fills out protocol deviation report to IRB. PI onlt has to press submit. Some IRB even allow CRA to fill their names in \"name of the reporter\" column.   \n- CRA fills out SAE report and give it to site staff to sign. But study coordinator will charge SAE reporting fee.   \n- severe delayed data entry and delayed query resolution and because study coordinator's English proficiency is less than subpar so CRA has to translate queries and write the answer for them.   \n- PI or SC will ask CRA how to document important decision, only to make sure the wording is comprehensive enough. It goes to show they don't know what comprehensive documentation looks like. \n\nDespite everything that I shared above, I don't see any truly diabolical and unethical behavious in my clinical research career in APAC. I don't see paitents being enrolled without a consent. I don't see data being fraudulaent (oh well I've never handled studies in China so I can't attest about whether 80% data from China is falsified). I don't see PI coerces patients to do anything.   \n  \nSo tell me, what did you hear?",
                "I do have to point out though so many CROs and Sponsor have been shifting their operation to low income countries and choosing sites (hospitals) there for a global study. For example when I was in AstraZeneca they started clinical operation in Malaysia and opened a new office there. Recently ICON announced layoff for all cinical trial assistant and hired people from India and Mexico. Same with Tigermed, you can log in the website and notice they even have an office in Laos (i was like what the fuck? when I saw it) Best thing about these countries is lower cost and fast recruitment.",

I would recommend getting familiar with that.\n\nYou are the head of the snake and if shits not going well it\u2019s your job to explain what\u2019s going on. Good PMs communicate often and early. Any delays or updates need to go to the team and action items need to be followed up and not sat on.\n\nGood PM are on top of their shit and can break down a study, the status, risks, pain points at a moments notice.\n\nIMO the learning curve is exponential when you get in but you learn to anticipate problems and think critically  in the process.\n\nHope this helps.",

There is it big picture and how a study is run. You may know these things but saying in case. \n\nYou may run many studies as a CRC but a PM or CTM will work with fewer protocols at a much deeper level.. working with function leads on site activation or with  a CRO, data collection,  study plans etc.I would move with this in mind while interviewing.",

Once you figure out a system that works for you, you\u2019ll feel much more in control and confident. I started out by using the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People method for planning my time and tasks, and now it\u2019s evolved into something a little more low key that works for my brain.

Staff at these sites are spread extremely thin so if you don\u2019t hear within a couple of weeks, contact them again as it could have just slipped between the cracks. \n\nI agree with all of the others\u2019 comments and want to recommend that if there is a research consortium on your disease, I would try to establish care as a clinic patient at one of the consortium sites, ideally the lead site if you can, and enroll as a participant in the research consortium. That\u2019s the best way to get on their radar. That way they already know everything they need to know about you before you are even screened for the trial, and they know you\u2019re interested in being contacted. This makes it easy for them and you\u2019ll also be receiving care from a team that is more specialized, well-connected and on the cutting edge of the science on your condition.\n\nIf this is one of the first or only drug/therapy trials for the disease, it may be very competitive enrollment unfortunately. Often the people who were involved with the natural history studies that would have proceeded the drug trial end up filling all of the available slots. I wish this weren\u2019t the case but it\u2019s the reality of clinical research at this time. \n\nBest of luck to you and I hope you are able to get into the study you want.",
                "From personal experience: my site\u2019s IRB does require it to be in the protocol, and they do not allow a standalone preceding ICF to be used- because if we\u2019re performing assessments for a study- even if it\u2019s just \u201cpre screening\u201d that\u2019s still what we\u2019re doing- the participant should have all of the information.

They won\u2019t even send us electronic blank pdfs of those most of the time. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. One study even required us to make all of our own CRFs and logs, and then decided to create required study-wide ones right after the study started. Hours of uncompensated, wasted time. \n\nI\u2019m glad this seems like it works well for you but I think there\u2019s also a huge lack of awareness in industry of some of these little things that add up to a ton of work for the site.",

It\u2019s not fine to act like we\u2019re beneath you- and only the stupidest people do that.",

Pretending to know things you don\u2019t know is seen as egotistical and a dangerous red flag.",

And we totally aren\u2019t- sometimes questions come up that no one who isn\u2019t on the site side would even think of- that\u2019s part of being a team is recognizing that we all have different perspectives and need different things to do our jobs. But I also feel like it\u2019s taken as an affront sometimes, and that will drive me to lose my patience pretty quickly.",

We\u2019re almost universally viewed as \u201cbeneath\u201d you, and we are supposed to put our heads down and do as we are told, no matter how stupid it is, and when we don\u2019t, we\u2019re a problem. So just remember whenever a site acts that way, they\u2019ve probably been treated that way too many times and that\u2019s how they\u2019ve learned to interact with you. It\u2019s not right and I\u2019m not defending it, but everyone needs to be the change they want to see here.",

Even one site out there that does that is too many. \n\nPSA to anyone who is reading this: these sites absolutely should be reported because if they\u2019re treating monitors like this based on anything other than the work they do and the way they treat you, you can guarantee they\u2019re also not providing equal enrollment opportunities to all participants. Research that doesn\u2019t truly represent the population is crap research, so they\u2019re \ud83d\udca9 scientists in addition to being \ud83d\udca9 humans.",

Travel reimbursement for subjects is a huge one in my realm, and also sponsors always complain first about what we ask in our budgets for CRC time- literally devaluing us and the time we spend on their studies. \n\nThe big one though, the one that really feels like blatant disrespect that has had me ready to leave research altogether more than once, is taking forever to answer questions that we need to have answered in order to move forward and then turning around and pestering us relentlessly- sometimes even berating us- if we let anything sit for a minute because we can\u2019t just drop everything we\u2019re doing and jump when the sponsor finally answers us. This occurs throughout the study, not just during startup. And we\u2019re usually already totally over it by the time the study starts- with years ahead of dealing with this sponsor that has already ruined their relationship with us. \n\nI really don\u2019t think a lot of people in industry are truly aware of the fact that site staff, especially those that are experienced and knowledgeable, are probably the scarcest of all resources in research. They are universally spread incredibly thin and are probably either burned out already or are working very hard to protect their energy (i.e. setting boundaries with demanding, unappreciative sponsors) so they don\u2019t burn out.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge cultural difference between industry and academia, and unfortunately there are a lot of aspects of industry culture that are totally incompatible with academia, and bridging that gap seems to fall on the site staff way too often. Some people on the industry side do get it, but there are certainly way too many who don\u2019t.",

Recognize your colleague's work, 3 months is not just a simple case of coverage. \n\nWhen you speak with your colleague, thank them and ask them for their feedback on using your tools and if they identified any potential tweaks to further improve them.\n\nYou should offer to share your tools with a broader audience and train them on their usage. \n\nDon't get stuck with those negative thoughts, turn the tables around, you got this!",

I\u2019ve seen it before as a way to ensure things are in place right away so a site can be activated the moment the SIV is over. There\u2019s no regulation against it, and the regulations do not specify any gate keeping to completing a DOA or timing as to when it should be in place - just that it should exist while you\u2019re doing the study and while those delegated staff are doing those things. Hell, the PI can make their own DOA, they don\u2019t have to use the sponsor\u2019s. \n\nThe PI just has to ensure that anyone delegated is appropriately qualified to do that task before they do it. That\u2019s completely up to the PI unless the protocol specifies otherwise.",
                "Oh, yeah, I definitely prefer to have a draft DOA ready to go! And again, we really prefer PIs to hold off on signing a DOA log until the SIV is completed.  But it is a gold standard preference, not a requirement. \n\nFDA guidance on the DOA states: \u201cThe Investigator should maintain a list of the appropriately qualified persons to whom significant trial-related duties have been delegated. This list should also describe the delegated tasks, identify the training the individuals have received that qualifies them to perform delegated tasks (e.g. can refer to an individual\u2019s CV on file), and identify the dates of involvement in the study.\u201d \n\nAs the FDA and regulations are vague on the specifics (they don\u2019t even mention using a training log!), so unless there is a sponsor required training matrix that is also cited in the protocol, PI can technically determine on their own what \u201ctraining\u201d means. If PI wants to say they hosted a meeting before the SIV to review the protocol in depth with their team and list that somewhere, great, they certainly can do that. That being said, they are gonna need to make sure the Sponsor doesn\u2019t have conflicting SOPs and requirements or else they\u2019ll never be activated. But some sponsors see no issue with a fully signed DOA ahead of the SIV for their study.",

No shade to nurses but what I'm trying to say is a nurse taking a job that's listed as CRC is not a \"step back\". The department probably asked for someone with experience for that particular position because they have a need for someone who can get up to speed quickly. Of course one can always apply even if they don't have all the posted requirements and sometimes it works out.",

The complaints are about bad DMs, who issue hundreds of queries years after the data was collected and then rushes us to answer them urgently, query asking us to answer a question one way and then re-query us asking us to change the data back and again, or use unclear language so we don't know what you're asking for and keep re-querying us without clarification.",

If you're going to make us change data back and forth because your lead can't make up their mind, at least be nice about it. There's a person on the over end of the screen. Site staff are likely to prioritize your study if you show some gratitude rather than threatening emails accusing staff of not working.",

If they're not willing to get that done, they're going to give you the run around for everything else you need from them too",

There are really a lot of different directions you could go. What are you interested in?",
                "When I was a CRC, I always wished there was a PRN staff member who could finish up small tasks so I wouldn't have to stay late or come in on weekends. Things like finishing up an enrollment that ran long, processing blood, maybe some light data entry if I couldn't finish during the day. \n\nWhat is your current department setup? How many full time CRCs? How many and what kinds of active trials do you have?",
                "Does your boss like you? Are you audit ready? If you're doing your job, I would just let this roll off your back and push back when sponsors are being overly demanding.\n\nCan you define what you mean by \"breathing down your neck\"? If you mean they were sending angry emails because you didn't respond to a query immediately, screw that. Human error happens and as long as you didn't let the query sit for weeks, you're fine. It's not your problem if the data team is behind schedule.\n\nRegarding enrollment numbers, just send them your screening log documenting the reasons why each patient was excluded. If you are missing enrollments due to staff coverage or because someone dropped the ball, then talk to your PI about it. If it's because patients declined consent or they didn't meet i/e criteria, there's nothing you can do about that. People are always looking for someone to blame but if the protocol was poorly designed or it's poorly managed, that's not your responsibility. Focus on doing your part well.",
                "The point of blinding is to prevent bias in treatment of subjects or in outcomes assessments. If it's not practically possible to make the two treatments look the same so that it is unavoidable that the staff administering the treatment will know the treatment assignment, you need different blinded and unblinded staff. For example, if the study is comparing patients who were treated with a medical device versus people who did not receive the device, there's kind of no way for the person who's setting up the device to be blinded. Some protocols will use sham devices but that can be prohibitively expensive and complicated. Another example is meds that have to be mixed immediately before administration.\n\nHow the tasks are divided up depends on the specific study procedures and staff capabilities. The important thing is that whoever does the randomization and IP-related tasks can't conduct the blinded assessments.",
                "The workload sounds normal. The pay is low. But if you are going to be applying for residency next year and aren't going to be staying in clinical research much longer anyway, I'd just focus on getting the most experience and connections as you can",

But 3-4 months is probably enough for most people to recover physically from childbirth (personally by that point I needed the intellectual stimulation and needed to be more than a parent for my mental health). But what's crazy to me is that the US doesn't offer universal childcare to enable more people to go back to work  These days it's not affordable for one parent to stop working, and most people aren't lucky enough to have much of a \"village\" to help.",

It\u2019s a career that I got into to feel like I am contributing to the health and well being of people and for the science but when a company demands the work and time over quality or experience in specific therapeutic areas of the CRA, that is when many CRAs become very discouraged and un-motivated in their CRA career.

I have loved being a CRA and feel I have built on my experience working on all sides of monitoring for sponsor, start ups and CROs (large and small). If I did not like this niche I would have moved into something else earlier. It also is the travel and demands and at 60 my stamina for that is waning. I don\u2019t mind a lot of the travel but the demands on top of that have changed dramatically. And I want to get back to the Sponsor side as I previously stated.

                "There are not really explicit guidelines on this AFAIK. My general advice would be that the principles of GCP require us to deliver accurate results from clinical trials regarding the therapeutics under investigation. As a result, you should generally come to the conclusion that items impacting primary/key secondary/secondary endpoints or key safety data (SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, etc.) probably fall into the category of not being consistent with GCP. But the \"how\" that is addressed in this particular situation are likely to be logistically complicated depending on if you're already filed your initial BLA, or if you have filed but are now doing a new data cut to submit as a major amendment, etc.\n\nNonetheless this is not your call alone. This is a decision that needs to be made in conjunction with data management, pharmacovigilance, stat programming, medical, stats, clinical, and honestly probably the C-suite if it's a \"small\" company as you say.  If that's not already the SOP at your company, then it should be and whoever wrote the SOP doesn't know what they are doing.\n\nSince this is an interim dataset, the logistics of unlocking/relocking can be very, very messy. For example, if you re-pull the AE database after unlocking to update this datapoint, it can be difficult to guarantee that nothing else was changed in the database by the sites (e.g. the site added another AE later which technically would have occurred during the intended analysis period).\n\n(the exact logistics depend a bit on how DM locked down the exact forms. Sometimes DM can unlock just a single form, but not always )\n\nAt the very least, the principles you need to follow are that you should expect to explain to an auditor what happened, how the issue was addressed, why you did it that way, that you recognize and documented this was a potential data integrity issue, and to produce documentation which clearly shows how that process was executed. Among those things, as you alluded, are performing proc compares of before/after datasets and the corresponding TFLs to ensure that the expected changes in the outputs match what was updated in the database. But there are other considerations, e.g. whether ALL TFLs should be rerun to ensure that timestamps are properly aligned, etc.\n\nThe exact logistics need to be carefully coordinated with DM and Stats programming, and the CRO if you are being supported by a CRO for any of those services.\n\nThis is one of the things that your VP of Biometrics is employed for and they really should be taking point on this.",
                "This is not unusual at all in oncology.\n\nE.g. initial BLA submission would be based on primary endpoint of progression free survival, but the study remains ongoing for overall survival follow-up as confirmatory evidence for full approval.\n\nThe level of data cleaning in such a scenario would be at the same level as a \"regular\" database lock (more than likely 100% SDV, all queries resolved, etc.) because it's being used in support of a regulatory submission. No sponsor in their right mind is going to submit data in support of BLA approval that has not been cleaned to that degree.",
                "Anything more I would need to charge my consulting rate :) \n\n  \nThe best advice I have for inspection is if it's not documented, then it didn't happen. The real concern most likely isn't whether a single data point will impact the approvability of your BLA-- that would be extraordinarily unusual and, to be honest, if one single data point can swing it your drug is probably not very good anyway. The main risk is losing credibility in the submission process and inspection findings.\n\nIf the BLA is already submitted, I would definitely be having conversations with regulatory team about what our options are. If it hasn't gone out the door yet, your options are probably either (i) unlock the form and re-pull the database, rerun entire SDTM/ADaM/TFL package and re-QC to ensure the only change is the one you expect or (ii) leave the database as it is, but document the change in the CSR. \n\n Again, the biggest risk is most likely the perception that the company doesn't know what they're doing ( not a great sign that there was a data issue in topline reporting for a pivotal study) and that you didn't properly have oversight of your CRO or weren't following your established processes. Documenting the issue and rerunning the TFL package to correct is the most transparent IMO. If the logistics of that are impossible with a live database, then document why it was felt to be impossible and how you mitigated it. \n\nBut the final call here is above your pay grade. This is why your head of Stats/Stat programming is employed.",
                "Biostatistician, i.e. study designer here. \n\nGenerally speaking, studies fall into 3 buckets-- Dose finding/safety, proof of concept, and pivotal/registrational. \n\nFor the former two, I would say that modifications to study design generally don't matter, so long as they support the goal of answering the question of \"what is the MTD/optimal dose of the treatment\" or \"does the treatment work in one or any patient populations\". Protocol amendments are a pain in the tushy, so nobody is going to bother amending a protocol that doesn't help accomplish one of those things. \n\nPivotal/registrational studies are more complicated. The ideal answer is always \"don't modify the study design\", because essentially any time you do once it's initiated, the integrity of the study can potentially be called into question. That said, shit happens. Studies take a very long time and are very expensive. Often we are trying to power a phase 3 study for overall survival when we had only very limited data in phase 2, or for example only mature progression free survival data without mature OS data. A new therapy which changes the standard of care in our comparator arm may have gotten approved. A competitor might have come out with new data that would suggest the bar we were aiming for would not be competitive. There's lots and lots and lots of things that can go wrong there where modifying the existing study design, generally in blinded fashion with oversight from data monitoring committees, is a better move than trudging ahead for several years and several hundred million dollars with an old design that doesn't quite make sense. \n\nSo, generally, in pivotal/registrational studies such modifications can work ok as long as the study is still blinded and it's relatively early on in enrollment. If you are very late in enrollment and/or the study is already unblinded, you are probably kinda up the creek.",
                "Data management is arguably the most important function in clinical research (sorry clin ops). It is the glue between operations and back end (stats/medical/medical writing). \n\nOutsourcing data management to the robots is a recipe for disaster. And contrary to popular belief, sponsors aren't actually stupid.",
                "On the sponsor side? I'd tend to say no. You still need someone to oversee CRO, develop SOPs, interface with leadership about DM-relevant topics, etc. That can't be easily outsourced-- different time zones with possible language barriers, etc.\n\nKeep in mind that for biotechs, on time and high quality databases are literally life and death. Biotechs need money to survive. How do you get money from investors? You show data. How do you get data you want to show when you need to show it to investors? At least part of that is good data management. It doesn't do a biotech any good to show partially complete data the week after JPM conference. We need complete data for JPM.\n\nFor big pharms with in-house data management, maybe. I don't have any experience there so I can't speak to it.\n\nOn the CRO side, I think the same generally applies to DM leads. Sponsors will definitely push back on DM leads in different time zones with language barriers, etc. As a stats lead, I still interact with my CRO data managers a decent amount and it would be pretty dead on arrival to me to have two competing bids where one had a stats/DM team on a totally different time zone and another not. I can't speak for DM services as much, but at least for Stats services I would abso-fucking-lutely push for taking the Stats part of the scope to a niche stats-focused CRO (think Cytel, Everest, etc.) if our full service CRO was trying to give me the run around. And I would win that discussion with leadership. It's the same thing with stat services-- good stats packages are how we present data to investors and it's critical that's it's on time and done correctly. It's not worth a 200k savings if it jeopardizes that.\n\nFor positions below data managers-- the support staff inputting queries, harassing sites, programming edit checks, etc. it might be a little easier for CROs to ship that to India or wherever. It's possible. I suspect it's going to be all fun and games, until someone does it and then there's a major audit finding that delays an NDA acceptance. Word will spread relatively quickly of who's doing it and how their processes have gone to shit, and then sponsors will start awarding studies elsewhere and the pendulum will swing back the other way.\n\nThe stupidity of sponsors is greatly exaggerated. We might be unrealistic, but we aren't stupid.",
                "I didn't say otherwise. \n\nCROs will still need a sponsor-facing DM lead that's based where the sponsor is (often North America, but non-NA sponsors also are biased towards their own localities too). It's just a fact. Anyone that would say otherwise has not sat through enough bid defenses to recognize it. \n\nThere is a lot of support staff underneath the DM lead and that, perhaps, can be done without compromising quality. But from a business development perspective (i.e. sponsors awarding contracts) it's not only quality that matters, but the *perception* of quality that also matters. CROs moving the majority of their operations elsewhere will risk the perception that the quality is not there, regardless of whether that's legitimate or not."

My first sponsor role was an entry level CTA one where the only requirements were to take directions well and be organized. I got my first big break as a sponsor CRA. \n\nWorking for a CRO is rigid, its structured and your roles are defined. You have metrics and what matters during interviews are the cold hard numbers you can present - DOS, # visits, # indications. They care about your performance in your role and how easy it is for you to jump right in. That's the only way you're billable.\n\nSponsors don't care about the metrics or how well you perform in your set role. They care about how much you're willing to work cross functionally and how you can redefine your role. They care about the teamwork and success of the pipeline and company and just not the clinical trial you're running. If you pigeonhole yourself into your role, you'll struggle.

The initial program should\u2019ve only been six months until transitioning into a CRA one from an in-house CRA. I was approached by another company for a CRA position amidst also being approached by icon for a position called a project specialist. This project specialist/analyst position would be a lateral move and another training program for a program. My initial intention was to stay with icon as I too wanted to go the management route. After a month or two going back-and-forth with my icon manager of getting some ass sororities of when I would progress to a program manager, what my salary would be, what would be the roles and responsibilities\u2026 I got radio silence. Upper management never had firm details, so I ended up taking the other CRA position which was a salary increase as well. Fast forward six months and the same in-house CRA\u2019s and project specialist have not been promoted.\n\nI only really this to you so that you can get an understanding of my experience there. I\u2019m not saying the icon position won\u2019t be amazing, but I would ask more questions about the position when you would be promoted and what the pay would look like. I would also ask management if they have already progressed some of these project analyst into the program management role.\n\nI finally ended up choosing the other CRA position because I ended up drafting up a proposal to my manager to bring to management to get more details of the project specialist position and was essentially ghosted \n\nAdvice to you is to be thorough with your questions for icon, and if you can try to get some of these things in writing that they are proposing for you. The one thing you don\u2019t want to do is get into a position and have no clear path For progressing.\n\nHope this helps"

                "I'm right with you on the deviations. We have one right now where it's a 'safety' deviation if the PI doesn't log in and sign off in 72 hours of EDC entry of SAE --- AND every change to the SAE entry. The PI still has to do the paper log and sign there, but submitting the paper is not enough for this sponsor. They require the PI sign into the EDC and verify that the CRC entered everything correctly. It's maddening trying to chase down these PIs!  We have two sites and normally when there is an SAE, they are never in the same office as me.\nOn top of that, if the SAE has to be reported to safety, a \"dynamic\" form shows up in the EDC. We asked for the questions in a format similar to the EDC guide and were told they don't have anything like that because the form is dynamic and changes based on your response to a question. We literally had to make our own source by waiting for an event, then pushing every button and recording the Q/As. They wanted the PI to sit there with the source binder, patient chart, and hospital records all at once and answer these questions? Do they know what a surgeon does in real life? The next craziest part is that our CRCs can answer like 90% of the questions without overstepping their bounds and making a clinical decision. \n\nThey are literally our only sponsor like this and I just got an email that they met enrollment goals. I have never been happier to see a study take the next step to moving on before we got too many participants enrolled!",
                "We have several ways to combat the pre-screen obsessed people. Not always effective, but it has helped. \n1. If you have your information in a database where you can pull reports, amend your SOP to be q2weeks.Then when you say it's your SOP to do pre-screen reports every 2 weeks, it's true.\n2. If they push back, you can then negotiate time or money. If they want them weekly, you say our fee for that is xx, whatever amounts to having the CRC work an extra hour or so on that protocol. If money isn't enough, negotiate time. You can say okay I will send the report weekly, but only have a recruiting update call monthly to balance the time spent.\n3. This one is easier if you have a lot of screeners reviewing patient charts in clinic or in hopsitals. Overwhelm them. Send in hundreds of prescreens a month and explain that a lot of people qualify but you cannot reach them all due to being only one person. I have had a couple sponsors tell me to stop sending them \ud83d\ude00\n4. Leverage your budget. Once we were budgeted to pre-screen 50 patients and then enter them into an external database. Once we hit 50, I offered to renew our original rate for another 50 via a budget amendment. Until the amendment was made, no more patients entered. We just received word on that trial that enrollment is closed and we never received an amendment!\n5. Budget suggestion #2... explain your fees for spending time with monitors. Our line items include on-site, remote with redaction of source, remote without redaction of source, monitor calls up to 30 min once a month. Explain to the sponsor that twice weekly contact with the recruiters was not budgeted into your time, like the monitoring was, and offer to add a line item for recruitment calls. For every single monitor contact in your budget, require they send a recap via email so that you can submit it with an invoice for your time. Sometimes this is enough to get the recruitment people to back off. If you are always answering emails, generating reports, talking to sponsors, when can you enroll?\n6. Play 'hardball', especially effective when you are enrolling at a pace that matches your contracted amount of patients. Just don't answer the email/call. Then when you come back, apologize for the delay, offer  an excuse (you were enrolling/doing xyz for their trial), and give them what they want on your timeline. Last I checked there were no deviations for not talking to a recruitment associate. The worst that could happen is that they 'tell on you'. I always recommend having your management/PI on board with these ideas prior to implementation.\nRealizing that you do not have to do everything the sponsor asks for every study has transformed my view of site based research. The site is like its own business. That means the site (generally) owns their data, develops their own SOPs, and negotiates their own budget. Responding to every crazy request a monitor has asked of me used to drive me nuts. Now I ask them to show me where it is required ( like a monitoring plan from the sponsor) or I push back in my own ways.\nI hope this helps. The monitor and the recruiter being two separate people has doubled our sponsor time. Can you tell its a pet peeve of mine?!?!?!"

You could potentially start with an academic job and apply for an H1B visa afterwards, or you may work diligently during your MS to accumulate journal publications and apply for an NIW green card. However, there are risks to consider, such as finding a job that sponsors your H1B visa after OPT and the uncertainty of the H1B visa lottery process. Additionally, it's important to assess the clinical research job market in your home country and determine if an NYU MS degree would enhance your prospects there.\n\nIt may take many years of work to recoup your tuition expenses, especially considering the high cost of living in NYC. So ultimately, it all depends on what your goals are.\n\nBest of luck!"

Someone once gifted me 2 university sweaters that I wear pretty much all the time when I travel.

Philip Beineke with email ending in careers-quantumleaphealthcare.com reached out asking if I'm interested in the job position 19APR2024. He sent me a questionnaire saying to consider it as initial interview. That there's no right or wrong answer. That's they're assessing my cognitive and problem-solving skills. Then after I submitted it they responded stating if the board deems me the best candidate they may not even do any additional tests as the job is in urgent need of filling on 22APR2024.

The part that threw me off is the most recent email,\u00a0 \"Congratulations, and welcome to our team! We acknowledge receipt of your signed offer letter. We look forward to starting your training and orientation program as soon as your supplies are delivered and installed. However, the funds to pay for the delivery of equipment to set up your workspace will be prepared and dispatched as soon as possible so that you can get it.\n\n\nPreviously, the company purchased the materials for our employees, but due to logistics issues and repeated errors that have been happening on the receipts of purchase from the vendor, it was decided that all newly hired employees would purchase the materials from the company's accredited vendors while the company provided the funds that would be used for the purchase. If you can work for the company for 12\u201316 weeks, the equipment automatically becomes yours, and your name has to be on the receipt of purchase to show that you made the order from the vendor.\n\n\nYou will receive a text from your supervisor,\u00a0Getriz Martin,\u00a0shortly, as you will correspond with her from here on out.\n\n\nPhilip Beineke\nRecruiting Specialist\nQuantum Leap Healthcare is an equal opportunity employer.

They rolled that out so that even if all 5 people on a team are awesome, only one can be a 1 and someone is always a 5. Then they cut everyone who is a 5. Then, a few weeks later the 4s get cut.

The rest of my team is kinda in a constant state of empathy fatigue and can't relate. Everyone keeps getting sick from overwork too, so I do feel bad about thinking of jumping ship",

We don't work on pharma trials thankfully. All of our work is for national and international data analysis and capture. I could easily move to a different organization doing the same thing, if I was certain all my issues were with my current manager/organization. I think it is largely oncology itself sadly. Lab research could be a much better option as I would have more separation between me and the patients. \n\n\nI may have to escalate to a higher up about my manager. I am not sure it will do anything, as she is very good friends with the head of the institute. \n\nThanks! It is hard not to feel like an overemotional mess (and trying to not let internalized misogyny sneak it's way in) when everyone around me has empathy fatigue and feels constantly numb to it all."

We often see a dozen or more modified studies at each meeting (which, as you mentioned, is an increase over what we saw years ago). \n\nA few we've seen lately, though, go far beyond that. In a few recent studies, new companies have purchased the companies that initiated the original studies, and the new companies appear to be piggybacking on existing studies (aquired through the purchases) to create entirely different research studies and circumvent the FDA. We are searching for guidelines on where an IRB can draw the line.",

At least one new endpoint was added out of the blue, which raised concerns. \n\nThe original study was a very sound study and had been modified a few times. It's not unusual for oncology studies to be modified repeatedly as they gather new information on PK and efficacy, process data. But usually we can tell there's a research trajectory that is legitimately an extension of the original study.",
                "Thanks for your reply - I'm on an IRB Board and we've encountered some oncology amendments that are extreme and do not clearly serve to continue the original study or studies. Most of the studies are not blinded (subjects and investigators need to know the dosages). \n\nAmendments are common in oncology studies and we've seen them for years. Prior to some very recent amendments, we have always been able to recognize that a series of such modifications serves to legitimately build on prior results and information in the study. My question relates to whether anyone has seen good guidance on when to draw the line. \n\nAt any rate, the board tabled one recent study because we could not defend it as being an identifiable extension of the original protocol and subsequent amendments. We are now looking for industry information on where other IRBs might be drawing the line.",
                "I'm on an IRB board, with more than 15 years' experience reviewing oncology studies for major clients. A study design can be ethical in terms of safety, but if it's an overly dramatic adaptation of a study that's already gone through the FDA and has been modified gradually as the research continues (that sort of modification is normal and happens all the time), then it ceases to resemble the original study submitted to the FDA. \n\nAppropriate modifications over a period of time (onco studies go on for years) are fine. Our board is searching for various guidelines others may have adopted for setting the bar on the degree of modification that is acceptable without going back to the FDA for further approval. We are seeing studies that resemble new research rather than iterations of ongoing research that reflect continuity.",

                "Depending on what your education is and where you live, a large Phase-I CRO could provide the training you want and need, and also offer opportunities for career advancement. You may need to relocate to the Drug Belt (eastern USA area) or to one of several CROs that are in other states. I worked at a large Phase I site and it was fun, fast-paced, interesting, and taught me a lot. I'm non-clinical, and I had my undergrad degree when I started there, so I was in a management area not requiring a clinical degree. \n\nThat CRO trained staff members on phlebotomy and other skills study teams needed to have. I believe they had an education benefit, and I know for certain they had a profit-sharing program. From what I could tell, it was a great place for new people in the industry to get excellent experience and grow into other positions. That was years ago and I am still in touch with many of the people I met there. \n\nThere are several large oncology CROs as well, and that part of drug research is still growing. Those sites may or may not have in-house units, but subjects in their studies have numerous outpatient visits over long periods of time. Based on what I know (I'm an IRB Board Member now, so I see studies all the time), there are likely staff members who do vitals, draw samples, etc. as well as medical professionals subjects see when on visits. \n\nRegarding smaller companies - you may want to make certain they have an ongoing need for whatever you want to do. One reason CROs are so popular (and needed) now is that drug and device companies often can't afford to have units or departments that conduct subject-level research. They focus on getting a drug or device developed to where it can be researched in humans, and then might work with a CRO (for drugs) or locate and contract with external investigators (for devices, as well as for drugs that are in later stages of human research). \n\nJust a few bits of info from my own experience.",
                "I have more than 20 years' experience on IRB boards, and one thing we often see are documentation gaps in what we need to review. The staff (I'm a consultant) often spends quite a bit of time going back and forth with the site to get missing documents for the submission, even basics such as the current license, additional documents for electronic signature platforms, etc. \n\nAs an NS board member, my frustration is with poorly written ICDs. We work hard to make sure subjects can read consent forms without stumbling over needless clinical terms in the midst of the text. My background is in writing (adjunct university professor) and I've crafted some of the phrases commonly used across the industry that help protect subjects as well as sites/sponsors. If I have to reread a phrase in an ICD to figure out what it means (happens more often than you'd think), then subjects will need to as well. So my contribution is often to create clarity in ICDs."

A lot of sponsors and CRO's want you you to have experience working for other sponsors and CRO's first and appreciate site side experience second making it hard to make this change. Also, entry level roles are not going to be as nice and I'd suggest being more open to travel and relocation (at least for 2 to 3 years to build her resume).\u00a0\nThis is the advice I'd give her. Remote is more competitive than in person and large companies are more competitive than smaller companies. She might find more luck looking for an in person job at a small biotech company (sub 10,000 employees). I'd also suggest updating her resume frequently, if she's not hearing back after 10-20 applications it might be a resume issue.\nLastly, I will say now is a bad time to be making this swap. A lot of these major companies are taking cost saving measures. I know of at least 3 or 4 major names that are trying to move their entry level junior roles over seas to reduce costs. This won't be permanent but it's going to be hard for her to find a job for the next year.\u00a0\nAs a bonus tip, LinkedIn is your best friend.

Which was your original claim. That endpoint actually repeats what I said but for a different study. Do you even understand what you typed?\n\nAlso PPD isn\u2019t even running that study lmao. Jfc.

I spoke with a recruiter last week who said it\u2019s become super common after covid, and I asked how she tells the difference. She said she looks at \u201cLinkedIn connections\u201d. I was shocked, because most of my \u201creal\u201d CRA friends have nearly nothing going on with linked in. If anything, that\u2019s the easiest thing to fake if I wanted to lie about being a CRA. \n\nAnyway, point being, I\u2019ve only encountered a few people claiming to have a vast history as a CRA and then not knowing basics, having a super vague recollection of how they got into research, and then talking to recruiters about what they\u2019ve encountered.",

Obviously a contract can\u2019t forbid me from escalating illegal activity but it doesn\u2019t mean the concern isn\u2019t there for retaliation. Would you mind sharing the approach sponsor usually takes if I came to them with this information?\n\nETA: she\u2019s very obviously completing nearly double the work in 2/3 the time. Sponsor sees this. It\u2019s really really hard for me to believe that they\u2019re seeing stats like: person a finished 350 pages, person B did 265, person C did 248, and person d did 700. There is no one on CRO or sponsor side who looks at those stats and thinks that\u2019s normal, so it\u2019s super discouraging to report to sponsor knowing they have the exact information I had that ultimately raised my red flags.",

Anyone who moves at half the pace (and there weren\u2019t any major findings that may have slowed that visit down) or double the pace is a red flag. Out of curiousity, why wouldn\u2019t someone moving over twice as fast than your next fastest person, at every single visit, not raise a red flag?

Assuming you are in the US or other high cost locale I would not recommend  these roles unless you were working towards being a DM Lead, due to the constant threat of outsourcing - even if you could even find an open position as they are quite scarce.",

I don't know Veeva and OpenClinica, but Medidata does provide training in Rave study build that you can pay for yourself, but it is quite expensive and I wouldn't bother as it won't be enough to make you competitive for clinical programming roles if you don't have other programming skills like SAS or object oriented programming.  If you go in a lead or support data manager, your company will provide the training you need on the EDC system they use.\n\nIf you are not aware there has been massive outsourcing of low and mid level DM and programming roles, and even some higher level roles, from high cost regions like the US and UK to low regions like India and LATAM during your time away.   I am US based and I am not familiar with the particulars of UK industry and job market, but on this side of the pond lower level DM roles are hard to find, and the market for lead DMs is not very good right now either. So don't be surprised if you have to search for a while.",

It would quickly become overwhelming.  Unlikely a sponsor would approve the budget to cover those extra hours! I have always been happy to work directly with CRAs so that they can walk the sites through the queries themselves - better the guidance come from someone the CRC already knows.\n\nAlso, once you establish a relationship, sites will call DM. In order to be effective, data reviewers need to be heads down and task focused. Dealing with constant phone calls will prevent them for doing that. The Lead DM is already in meetings all day and won't have time for talking to the sites.\n\nI tell my teams no more than two re-queries before you reach out to the CRA, and if they think the issue warrants it they don't have to re-query at all before reaching out to the CRA. It is helpful if the data reviewers can dialogue directly with the CRAs and not have to go through the Lead DM and the clinical lead, but that may not work on larger or global studies."

I\u2019ve done everything from stroke studies, where you just need enough staff to be on call overnight, to phase one oncology, where you have 50+ people on any given DOA. At a small site, you\u2019re doing everything\u2014contracts, budgets, regulatory, patient visits, data cleaning, monitoring visits. \n\nI\u2019m working with a few small sites at the moment and a pattern I\u2019ve noticed is that they don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know. Things that seem obvious\u2014singing and dating ICFS, signing and dating DOAs, maintaining source, recording test results, timely data entry\u2014 are all issues I see regularly. \n\nSo first I\u2019d recommend paying a bit above market rate to ensure you get a few knowledgeable staff members. You probably know a lot, but you definitely don\u2019t know everything. Finding another person or two with a lot of experience will help. \n\nFocus on quality over quantity. It\u2019s really hard to change ingrained work habits/ culture, so it\u2019s important to start with high standards. Invest in training newer or less experienced staff members.\n\nI also like the recommendation of starting small. You don\u2019t want to bite off more than you can chew and end up with a bad reputation or 483.\n\nAlso highly recommend getting familiar with sites like Veeva, Versa trials, and redcap/ advarra (if you\u2019re doing any investigator initiated research)",

It is so useful for sites to have a really clear list of what the monitor wants to see during their visit. Some of our studies have dozens of binders (phase 1 oncology), so even saying \"I want all treating subject binders\" or asking for specific subjects is extremely helpful.\n\nETA: and it's also really useful to know ahead of time so that we aren't trying to track down some random log or form during the IMV.",

My presentation went well and then they asked me a bunch of situational questions; how would you handle this, do you have experience with that, give me an example of a time when, etc.\nI\u2019d recommend reflecting on unique experiences in your career that you can reference for questions like that. They also took some time to answer my questions.\n\nFor me response time was very quick. I was given a job offer within 3 business days of my interview. Negotiation took about 48-hours, and then I signed the offer letter. \n\nYour overall experience may vary based on the HR representative you\u2019re working with as well as the team your interviewing for."

                "A big pain point has been central IRBs not catching or being concerned with ICF workflow. Say they approved a site in 2020 with an English ICF and a Spanish ICF alongside Version A of the protocol. Then the site submits Version B of the protocol with an updated English ICF, but no Spanish update. I would love it if the IRB noticed the lack of an updated Spanish ICF being included, or better yet, referenced it in their approval letter and provided guidance on how to handle consenting Spanish-speaking patients when you don\u2019t yet have a current Spanish ICF that matches the current protocol. \n\nWCG has been terrible for us lately when trying to keep basic documents straight.

NONE were reported. \n\nThere were instances where spinal cultures had been taken during the index hospitalization, came back positive, reviewed by the PI/Sub-I, pts were having active signs and symptoms (headache, sudden spike in WBC outside of post-op spike, increase neutrophils, high sed, fever) and the patients were discharged without any antibiotics or intervention. One patient died and at least three came back a few days later in terrible sepsis.\n\nIt was also the first site I had as a monitoring CRA after working years as an Infectious Disease CRC. I reported them to the FDA because I was truly appalled and concerned.",

We closed the site less than a year after that (Sponsor wanted to \"give them a chance\" to turn things around but I felt they were already too far gone). The PI did eventually get diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and had to stop practicing. I wonder if the brain tumor was impacting his judgement already at the time. Not sure what happened to the CRC, but the site website and her linkedin have remained unchanged. \n\nThe site also had many other egregious issues - lack of source, obvious fraud, nonexistent device accountability, multiple patient records all bundled in one loose-leaf paper pile because they hadn't bothered to make subject binders or organize anything. The CRC also couldn't be bothered to make sure she had the correct ICF version when consenting a patient. \"Oh yeah, I knew it was an old version when I consented them, but it's not like I'm going to walk back upstairs to get the correct ICF\" she said to me. Her office was one floor up from the clinic. \n\nBut I was most flabbergasted by the fact that this huge university hospital did not have a system of checks and balances for basic patient care - if an ortho pt got a spinal infection, no one was consulted. Not Neuro, not ID. They literally just left it up to this one ortho group who constantly had ridiculously high rates of post-op infections and poor outcomes. I really do hope that the FDA came in and did an inspection and that things are better there now.",

But being detailed oriented and juggling lots of tasks of varying degrees of difficulties and competing priorities is part of most roles in the industry (and true for many other industries, as well).  You may just not be in a good fit for your specific site, though.  If they expect CRCs to already understand what's going on and don't provide adequate training then entry level CRCs will fail.  It's not like that everywhere though.  There's some external training you can take on yourself - Socra, ACRP, etc.  But learning your sites SOPs, guidelines,  processes, etc is where the bulk of the training comes in.  I doubt you're stupid!",

If you don't have that in place, it's not necessary.  So not really wrong or right whether you do it.  Someone could just be logging the Temps and a study team member takes action on any excursion, for example.  At that point it isn't protocol specific and doesn't require training that isn't part of typical duties...and therefore isn't a delegated task (much like phlebotomy on many studies).",

Sometimes we would partner with PCPs, community hospitals, etc to have alerts sent to us when possible patients were identified.  Sometimes the patient would reach out after engaging with some type of recruitment materials and would have no prior relationship.  But all medical history, labs, diagnoses, etc would be confirmed as part of the protocol - whether that is chart review or by administering new exams, labs, etc.  Research-only centers also typically have a patient database they can use to reach out to previous participants, participants who were excluded from other trials, or who just have a general interest in whatever type of research is being conducted.",

Depending on what exactly has to be confirmed, I've seen it be allowed for patients to bring records in themselves.

                "Like all things in clinical research, this feeling is cyclical. I\u2019ve been a WFH CRA since 2011. I was an in-office CRA from 2008-2010. Some years things are good and some years you\u2019re drowning. This directly relates to boom and bust cycles in hiring. \n\nMost people, myself included, were doing fine in 2021 and 2022, started to notice losing work-life balance in 2023 and are now completely drowning (hence the lack of my YouTube videos). This is exactly what happened in 2007 with a hiring boom, 2008 people started to notice losing work-life balance and in 2009 they were drowning. Though I wasn\u2019t in clinical research then I\u2019m told the same cycle happened between 1999 to 2001. \n\nProblem is the completely drowning phase is also when there aren\u2019t many jobs so people get stuck and can\u2019t quit and companies are aware of this. Productivity is maintained by less people working more and companies can cut headcount and cost. Ultimately, though, quality of work declines and people become unhappy and new hiring is forced. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s WFH versus in-office that matters much (unless you have some awful commute). It\u2019s adequate resourcing versus significantly inadequate resourcing that makes the greatest impact. This is my takeaway from about two decades of working in clinical research.",
                "Sorry to hear that. The mass layoffs aren\u2019t over. I expect to see hiring pick up in 2026. There are going to be lots of layoffs in 2024, 2025 will somewhat stabilize and more substantial hiring will occur again in 2026. Similar after the bust in 2009, hiring picked up in 2011.",

However, anyone that has worked in both regions, knows quality of life is infinitely better in Europe while you can make more money in the U.S. There are pros and cons depending on what you want.\n\nI do feel European CRAs are somewhat underpaid but also tend to have a much better work-life balance. It used to be standard when I started in the U.S. to get 10 days of paid vacation a year. You were lucky if you got 15 and anything more was unheard of. Many places went to unlimited PTO which aggravated the problem with people even being scared to take days 10-15 days off a year. In Europe, 30-40 days is not uncommon. Then there\u2019s health insurance in one versus the other. And, so much more. However, in terms of raw dollars made, you\u2019ll be better off in the U.S.\n\nThat\u2019s why many people, including me, work in the U.S. for the money but will retire in Europe for quality of life and healthcare. Off topic, but I wanted to clarify the people are talking about European CRA salaries.",

The facility overall was really nice, but they had a big space crunch, so none of the actual office rooms were available for monitors. The \"monitoring room\" was a storage closet with a shelf hung at desk height for your laptop. Probably ten square feet at most, with no window or ventilation.",
                "Being a CRC is a difficult job that academia doesn't really prepare you well for. Honestly, you could probably take a person with no medical academic experience whatsoever but who has been working an office management job for years, and they'd adapt more quickly to the CRC role than someone with a background in medical academia. The CRC learning curve is *steep*, and you (and every other new CRC) are going to fuck up a lot before you really get it down. Don't beat yourself up, recognize and learn from your mistakes, and don't be afraid to ask for help from your more senior colleagues. Soon enough, you'll have your ducks in a row and you'll be the one who the junior CRCs are coming to with their questions.",
                "Know who to go to for help on whichever topic/area.\u00a0\n\nThis is hugely important. I've been in the clinical research industry for 20 years now, and one of the few things I've noticed that's applicable to every single company I've ever worked for is that there is almost never a clear and intuitive delineation of responsibilities, There's so often a huge overlap between positional responsibilities that you'll find that people who fill one role on one study have a significantly different scope of responsibilities than someone with the same role on another study, even if the sponsor is the same. Make notes about the responsibility and contact tree for each study you're working on (OneNote is really good for this) and refer it it frequently. If you're a CRA, your sites are probably going to assume that you're the point of contact for literally all questions, and since that's probably not accurate, having a quick reference guide for whom to redirect questions to is a HUGE time saver, and will make both site staff and your study team think you're really on the ball.",
                "This really depends on the company. I've worked for a few CROs, and the only one where I ever had trouble getting my PTO approved or coverage for my sites was (to the surprise of precisely zero people) Medpace. Neither or those were ever issues at Covance or Parexel.\n\nI think the one issue I've noticed across CROs is that they will go out of their way to set up unmeetable performance metric requirements as a specific attempt to screw you out of your annual bonus.",

Going from site, to cro, then to sponsor - there needs to be improvements with LIRB, Advarra, & WCG. \n\nAdvarra is the best imo despite there is disruption with their teams like it is every where. \n\n1. Sites that use utilize LIRB solo, certificate to waiver to central, or \"central as local\" need to give the sponsor/cro reps a detailed process and meeting times/submission deadlines when SSU begins. Cro/sponsor needs to know what you will work on before submission or concurrent with submission.  Also ethic boards need the same information sent to sponsor/cro ssu reps. Do not leave us in the dark for ffs.  We have dates planned for sites based on historics and study needs and we need to get you ready in a timely manner \n\n2. Advarra and wcg: I like them both. I do prefer advarra tho since forms are built in with in and there are no smart forms to download and re-upload like wcg has. I do wish there was a way to list the approval and tne approved documents grouped together.. advarra has the best tho when reviewing approvals and approved docs in chronological order. \n\n3. Give the sites a chance to review and approve the ICFs and then allow the sponsor/cro to sign off.  Advarra does good on this if instructed to. \n\n4. Wcg - I do not like how it is set up with box tabs to action items, submissions, etc.  I do like I can easily find a site tho especially if I have a site on multi studies and trying to audits. \n\n5. Central IRBs need better training/videos for sites on submissions, continuing reviews, ICF reviews etc. Ultimately, it is the sites responsibility to train their staff on the IRBs. It would be nice if the IRB set an expectation/training as part of having an account with them imo.",

When you say \u201cupgrade validation,\u201d is the upgrade being done internally by your company? \n\nOr is it the typical scenario with most software, where you log in one morning and see a pop up saying version has been updated \u201csee release notes here\u201d? or something lol (where the customer has no control over the upgrade releases).\n\nApologies, I\u2019m just not familiar with OnCore haha. Do you like it?",

Respectfully, that isn\u2019t really answering what I wanted others to share; I want to hear from other sites that use these tools what collection of documents do they produce when the auditor says \u201cplease show me your CTMS validation\u201d. \n\nI think it\u2019s awesome that you guys provide that at the time of implementation and our team really appreciates it; but it doesn\u2019t cover the bit I\u2019m asking about which is more concerning \u201cwhat additional documentation/validations are other sites regularly creating, and responsible for providing when asked\u201d. \n\nThe fda guidelines are pretty fuzzy imo, and I\u2019m trying to figure out how other clinical/site staff have chosen to interpret their obligation (in addition to what the vendor provides). Basically, is everyone else regularly validating every feature when an update is released? Keeping that documentation on hand? Every new major platform upgrade? (This is why I\u2019m asking, because it would be additional work for the site to be responsible for doing\u2014 not just covered by a 1 time courtesy validation at time of implementation).",

I think that\u2019s a big part of why the \u201cother\u201d method seems weird to me. Our company/sites, we have no control over when a release occurs. Sure, plenty of software vendors love to tease upcoming new features\u2026 sometimes we see them, sometimes it takes longer. But for the actual version upgrade, we have no way to test it ahead of time and know how it\u2019s going to work. It\u2019s just \u201chey we changed stuff overnight and ta-da, it\u2019s been upgraded!\u201d Haha. \n\nLike to me, it feels like the equivalent of getting a newly approved ICF on the morning of a scheduled visit. Like, not ideal. I have to consent with the right version so I have to scramble to figure out the changes before walking into the patient room.\n\nFor sites that are using a Crio/realtime validation script they provide to internally validate the change, I\u2019m wondering how they avoid staff using the updated version of the platform while someone is performing the validation\u2026 like, we had no control over the day it was released. If validating the change is so necessary for quality, wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to try and say \u201cno one use Crio/realtime this morning; we just got an upgrade and we need to validate it first\u201d <- that\u2019s obviously super impractical for a research site lol like I don\u2019t think the business can afford to halt operations. But if the alternative is to let people use it still while internally validating the release like\u2026 it feels like a moot point? Your users are \u201cvalidating\u201d it at the same time, by actively using it in their visits lol. \n\nI realize I\u2019m way over thinking this but gosh it just feels like adding a lot of busy work to a platform entirely outside of our control. Busy work that isn\u2019t really going to change anything. Busy work that the vendor had already done prior to the release.\n\nI hope more people share what they do!

                ">you guys are building your own databases?\n\nYes, and they're a bit unique, in a way.\n\nThere are basically 2 types of databases we're building:\n\nOne is the sort of standard CRO EDC system.\n\nThe other, which I've been put in charge of designing, is a sort of EDC system that's divorced from any clinical trial, and just used by the sites for their own purposes (so they can collect and analyze their own data more efficiently).\n\nBut, for both, we want to have a standardized method for communicating to the programming team what the requirements are for a new study, for functional changes, etc.\n\nBasically, just a standardized CRF Specs template that will work for both worlds.\n\n>I'm hoping to start one of our new studies that way towards the end of the year and I'm super excited. \n\nThat's awesome! Bigger projects like this are super exciting!!\n\n>My concern would be first about SOPs for your build and validation process, and also how you describe it in the DMP.\n\nSo... That's where things are a bit interesting... Currently, even for the CRO side of the business, there basically aren't any SOPs yet; only within the last year has the company gone from a 6 person team to a 60 person team, so no one has really had much time for documentation and defining processes yet. It's still very much in the \"flying by the seat of your pants\" stage of things. There are currently several people working to improve the documentation and process definitions, but it's still a bit behind.\n\nAnd for the side I'm working on, that isn't directly connected to any clinical trial, there isn't even a DMP or anything, as we won't really be doing much data management directly; all of the data belongs to and is controlled by the sites, we're just giving them the tools they need to collect, analyze, and share their data, more or less.\n\nWhile we still do need SOPs and whatnot, it's a bit of a greyer area than most clinical EDC systems (even on the CRO side, the contracts we have are designed in such a way that puts us in a bit of a regulatory grey area).\n\n>The other thing I'd encourage you to consider with template creation like this is at a small company you have more stakeholders than just other DM & programming\n\nAt this particular company, it really is just the DMs and programmers that would use the document; upper management is kind of great in that they put full faith in the employees to do what they know is right, so there isn't a lot of micromanaging from other departments or anything.\n\nAnd the programmers are pretty much all in India (and it's only a team of 6 devs), and their English isn't especially great; we have one go-between person, the CTO, so my primary goal with the document is to try to make communication between the American DMs and the Indian programmers as simple, clear, and consistent as possible.\n\nThat said, based on what you and someone else said, I might scrap the standard variable codebook idea; to me, it seemed like a decent way to reduce redundant work and make any modifications to standard fields a bit more readily apparent.\n\nMy thought was that, for example, if the options for gender are so consistently the same, it can be easy to miss when they're slightly different for a particular study, so if you have a standard that you can reference, then specify when it needs to be modified and exactly what about it needs modification, it might prevent issues of \"oops, I saw gender and assumed it'd be the same as usual, so didn't actually read the full specification for it\".\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nMaybe there's a better way to avoid that sort of thing, or maybe I'm just over engineering a solution to a problem that isn't as likely as I fear it could be. Idk.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful feedback, though!! I really appreciate it!! I'll try talking with my boss about prioritizing SOPs more; I do agree with you that they *should* come first, but there's also a lot of pressure to deliver the products we've been promising people, so it can be a tough sell to justify any delay in the product for the sake of documentation, ya know?",
                "I suspect that the fairly recent uptick in layoffs throughout the industry over the past year or so has to do with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates (in an attempt to combat inflation, supposedly).\n\nWith higher interest rates on loans, companies are less likely to take out loans to fund things like clinical trials.\n\nAs a result, there basically isn't enough business in the industry to support the same number of workers that it was before (because, of course, executives and shareholders settling for slightly lower short-term profits is never an option).\n\nIt sucks; businesses like CROs probably suffer the worst, and the soonest, since they rely on what's basically B2B sales for revenue, and aren't necessarily required, in the short term, for their clients to stay afloat. \n\nAnd the Fed announcing today that they still aren't going to cut rates yet will probably result in even more layoffs throughout the industry in the coming months.\n\nIf I'm right that the layoffs are primarily just a result of the high interest rates, at least that means that once they're lowered back to normal, companies will likely be rehiring a lot of the people that were laid off, and the job market in the industry will mostly revert back to normal.\n\nWho's to say, though; corporate greed makes any shitty scenario possible.",
                "I might be misunderstanding what you're referring to, but I think it depends on the underlying cause of the Sponsor-side layoffs.\n\nIf they're laying people off because they think they can get someone else to provide the same value for cheaper, then yeah, that'd result in more contract opportunities for CROs.\n\nIf they're laying people off because they're investing in fewer studies (due to the high interest rates), though, I don't see how that could result in *more* opportunities for CROs.",

I missed their call while working. Tried calling them back once or twice.

This is big. They can save you *a lot* of time and money!\n\n2) Start an LLC for yourself (unless your accountant advises differently). It'll help with taxes and insulate you from potential liability issues. You can often also get better credit cards and loans as an LLC than you would otherwise.\n\n3) Keep your business and personal expenses as separate as possible. Having a business credit card through the LLC can help a lot with that. Just make sure to *never* out personal expenses on the business card (though, depending on how your LLC is setup, you may be able to use the card to pay yourself in the event that your contract expires or is cancelled; talk to your accountant about that).\n\n4) Put damn near everything necessary to work on the business CC; whether it's gas to travel to an office, coffee, cost of a co-working space if you work remote and enjoy those, high-speed internet if you work from home a lot, lunch, a laptop, a desk, health insurance, whatever. You can write *a lot* of stuff off on your taxes, to the point that you can often end up paying less in taxes than you would as a regular employee. Your accountant should be able to help you figure out everything you can count as a business expense.\n\n5) If you can, try to ensure there's something included in your contract(s) that gives you some type of cushion/severance in the event of it being cancelled early; maybe 1 month's worth of full-time wages if your client elects to cancel the contract early. This can be difficult to negotiate and a bit risky, since a lot of companies have standard contracts they want you to sign, so carefully weigh how important that security is to you vs the risk of them saying \"nevermind, we'll hire someone else\" and not having other potential clients available.\n\n6) If you can, try to ensure that either overtime is included in the contract or you have a hard-cap at 40 hours of work each week. Again, though, contract negotiations can be difficult/risky, so weigh the importance of this vs the risk.\n\n7) Bill them for *every last second* that you spend working; don't let them talk you into doing *anything* \"off the clock\" or \"as a favor\".\n\n8) Always keep in mind that you are *not* an employee; you aren't obligated to do anything that's not outlined in your contract that you don't want to do. If your contract doesn't specify joining daily meetings, for example, they cannot make you join daily meetings.\n\nI hope this is helpful, and I wish you nothing but the best of luck!!!",
                "I forgot to add, but in addition to a CC for the LLC, you'll also want a checking and/or savings bank account for it and have any payment deposited to those accounts (you can then transfer funds from them to yourself; talk to your accountant about how you want to do it, though, because there are some options with regards to how you pay yourself that could yield some additional tax savings)",

                "A few things I saw from reviewing your resume\u2026\n\n1. First, state your name, email and contact phone number.\n\n2. Summary: remove the numbers. Brag about yourself but also talk about what you want to achieve at the new organization. Don\u2019t bold and emphasize your masters degree. \n\nProficient at CTMS, EDC and eTMF systems should be in skills not in your summary. Also everyone in clinical research will probably list this on their resume.\n\n3.Education should be at the bottom after work experience and skills should be where the education is. The first line is good enough. Since you also finish and received a degree. Relevant coursework is irrelevant since you completed it. \n\n4.Bolded text\nI suggest putting some of some of them in your skills if your trying to highlight you have experience working on placebo controlled trial, CTMS, EDC, eTMF systems. Including bolded text on the resume can make or break your chances. Your basically giving recruiters to look at summarize bolded test and not read anything else. \n\n5.Skills should be place above experience and under Summary. Phases of clinical trials should be 2-4, speciality in oncology and other areas. Microsoft Office- everyone uses this. It\u2019s not unique get rid of it.",

It\u2019s a huge learning curve and a disservice to the sites. \n\nThat being said, looking for clinical research nursing (CRN) positions, not CRC.

You\u2019re not going to have it because that role is an entry level position. I have *never* seen a hospital/clinic require a nurse to step back in their career as CRC, then back to a CRN. That makes no sense.\n\nThey can however require that you have pertinent experience, such as oncology, but that\u2019s really all I have seen, but not CRC before CRN. You\u2019re a nurse, not a coordinator. \n\nAlso, please look at other hospitals around you or other clinics. If that place you\u2019re applying to is strict, then maybe somewhere else might be a bit easier to get into. \n\nThis is all coming from someone who just had a year working as an RN, and applied to the CRN job that wanted me to have a masters and I didn\u2019t. I still got the job. \n\nJust apply anyways, and see where you go with it!",

Not only that but you need to factor in school loans, I\u2019ve noticed programs like the one you\u2019ve mentioned can be pricey. There are other routes you can take with it being cheaper\u2026so I beg you to not take huge loans out for a program that can be done cheaper. Also, do you need the masters? \n\nThe other thing to weigh is your mental health. If it\u2019s taken a hit now, nursing school isn\u2019t going to help anything, trust me.\n\nLastly, are you interested in bedside nursing?

                "Like everything else in my life I start to need a change if I do it for too long. I was fully remote from like April 2020 until the beginning of 2023 when I changed jobs, and by then I was ready to get out of the house. Something weird happened though when my previous job started allowing us back in the office around I think early 2022 - I didn't want to do it, I wanted to just start fresh going in somewhere else. Only reason I can think of for this is that they (my previous place) stopped using about half of our office space which is where my office was (nearly all of us had individual offices w/doors and most had windows) and I didn't want to go through booking a shared space on the unfamiliar floor etc. after that long of not going there.\n\nNow, because I can walk to work, it's not as stressful as driving and the walk to/from is a nice way to transition in and out of work mode, and leave it all there. I have flexibility for 2 days remote/week and sometimes I do none, often I'll do 1 and sometimes I do 2. This is a pretty good situation but if I were to move and have to drive in, I'd probably take both remote days.\n\nWhat I'm saying with this reply is maybe try a hybrid scenario if you feel up to it and wouldn't have a rough commute?"

Depending on which side of the table they\u2019re on, SAE documentation is redacted when sent from the site to the sponsor. It\u2019s insane, but if it\u2019s all redacted it may not be *as* insane. Do they work from home? Are they responsible for managing some aspect of these SAE\u2019s? Maybe imperfectly configured technology or gaps in processes leave them responsible for tracking SAE\u2019s in some special way that they take care of at home? This sounds like the sort of bizarre practice that can happen when ad-hoc processes or temporary fixes are made on the fly with only the immediate problem in mind. \n\nThe other half of me wonders if they are keeping them as evidence of something. Who knows?",

Now, no sane sponsor actually has the Investigator/site details listed within the protocol. Instead, they separately submit CV/FDA 1572. But from a purely regulatory perspective, you are submitting part of the protocol when submitting a\u00a0site. Hence the FDA considers it a protocol amendment\u00a0to the IND when the sponsor adds a new site to an ongoing trial (and it's classified as such on the submission cover sheet, the 1571).

Even when I go on site, most the PIs still only want to meet by phone (oncology). Even if it is a week or two after the visit, I insist on that call.\n\nMost of these are less than 5 minute conversations. Sometimes I have chatty PIs or ones that like to ask questions but usually you just word vomit to them, ask if they have any questions (they won\u2019t) and then end of discussion. \n\nThen carefully summarize everything you told them for your report (do it while it\u2019s fresh I your mind) and then I will take that same summary discussion and stick it in my f/u letter too so that anyone who reads it is aware of what the PI and I discussed. \n\nSome sites will have the whole team on the PI call and others I call the PI directly so I want everyone to know what was said.",

There are clinical research jobs with the VA but you have to be move to Boston, Palo Alto, DC, Baltimore, etc where the major VA research centers are.\n\nAlso to be clear while you may have the title of a CRA, you are doing study coordinator work\u2026..that\u2019s not a knock or a dig but you will have no easier time transitioning to traditional CRA jobs at CROs than any other research coordinator.\n\nYour time will come, keep working and just always be in the habit of looking for your next gig."

Biggest mistakes I see: designing like the eCRF is on paper; forgetting the end user experience; asking for the same exact datapoint in multiple places / in the wrong form \n\nIf you have a crappy EDC builder: None of the above applies; specify every single detail \n\nA visit schedule is fine, but know that I am going to trust the protocol over your Visit Schedule tab.  Don\u2019t get caught up specifying precisely how visits / folders / matrices should roll out; this can be discussed with your builder directly. \n\nContacts should be separately maintained outside of CRF specs.\nInstructions: I probably wouldn\u2019t find this too useful unless the study is super complex.\nSpecial specs: Again, don\u2019t overthink or over-dictate this, unless your builder sucks\n\nEdit: I personally would not like the standard variable code book tab at all.

We either bounced around horrid jobs in manufacturing, service industry, or call center, or (if we were lucky) management consulting/accounting  jobs at a  \" big 4\". KPMG literally sent emails saying that 50 billable hours per week minimum were expected during busy season, which translated to 70 hour work weeks for months.\n\nI do empathize because I know that it sucks even more now with housing/inflation and the economy in general, however I think it's important to set expectations if you have a four year degree with no specific professional training. Most jobs that are available that pay well with benefits and a somewhat regular white collar schedule are going to be difficult and demanding.

The bonuses are usually nice. So I feel like the years I spent grinding as a CRA paid off for me.",

Keeping in mind, sites are told that they must maintain daily access to sponsor portals. Your CRA is likely following (imho, misplaced and ill-informed) orders from above. I actively ignore this \u201crule\u201d simply because there is nothing in my SOPs that says they can\u2019t. So I encourage my CRAs to access site portals to save trouble. However, I do ask them to write remote site contact reports to document what they do. \n\nIn the end it\u2019s all about following company policy. You can ask to clarify this with your CRA and their manager. It\u2019s likely that they may very well have a rule against using site portals.

For non-nationals, it is, for all intents and purposes, a rough equivalent to a US Social Security Number. You will not be eligible for US Social Security benefits. In the US, citizens use their Social Security Numbers as de facto tax ID numbers. Since you\u2019re a non-citizen, there is a workaround allowed by the US-Canada Income Tax Convention (treaty). This is to prevent double taxation.\n\nFollow the process at: https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayer-identification-numbers-tin\n\nYou will need to complete and mail the Form W-7 to the US IRS. You will need to put your Canadian SIN in box 6b. \n\nI *believe* your reason selection would be Box A. You are from Canada, and the associated tax treaty section which you would be claiming benefits is XIV, independent personal services. You will need this so you do not get double taxed on the income. \n\nI am not a US tax attorney but this is generally the process. You can find more information online or by reaching out to an approved US tax attorney.\n\nPlease keep in mind that crossing the border into the states as a Canadian is a complete different process from obtaining a US tax ID number and while most Canadians do not require a visa for up to a six month stay in the US, the border agent had ultimate authority to exclude you if they suspect that you are here to perform work for which a visa is usually required, and they\u2019re fully within their rights to do so. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a few subjects kicked out by USCIS because of dodgy incomplete paperwork, poor comprehension and explanation of what they\u2019re doing here, and we\u2019ve had to send letters of invitation to our partners to make everyone happy. So just be vigilant. You\u2019re not doing anything dodgy, but the border agents tend to be very twitchy people.\n\nWhen you DO get your ITIN, you provide it on a form W-8BEN to the requestor (clinical trial site). An American national doing the same process would provide their SSN on form W-9. Note: We do NOT provide our actual Social Security Number card to *anyone* for review.

Or even in otherwise quite healthy individuals who over train (causing CNS exhaustion) or are suffering from high and chronic stress levels (again causing exhaustion). We don't know how the person in the case report ate or what happened to her weight, but she was most likely running a calorie deficit for two years consecutively. That is quite a long time and to pull that off with keto (or any other diet for that matter), you really need to take care to get proper amount of macro and micro nutrients. Also there could be several other reasons for cognitive problems, one of them simply being at a big calorie deficit for a long time, which can be reproduced with any diet. The fact that the person in question changed diet to non-keto and then her condition improved, doesn't really prove that keto was causing the problems in the first place. Usually if you have been at a deficit for a long time, generally your condition improves with just adding more daily energy from any source, keto or not."

Also the lack of evidence and studies on those following a keto diet long enough and consistent enough to get real data from.\n\nWhat would be great is a study that test groups of people who have been following keto for a long time vs people who have not. Each group is divided in three, high protein, adequate protein, low protein to see the effects. My understanding is that on very low carb diets GNG runs pretty consistently to make up for the lack of dietary glucose (is this true?) and testing varying levels of protein in both keto and non keto dieters would hopefully help separate the rate of GNG happening from lack of dietary glucose (demand) vs the GNG happening because the body doesn't know what to do with excess amino acids (supply). Apologies of this exists already, I have not seen one but would love to read it if anyone has it \n\nHigher protein intake affects the production of ketones, I don't even think that's controversial to say even at r/keto. But can it actually halt ketogenesis in the same way that consuming glucose can or does it just temporarily reduce it?\n\nWill eating \"high\" protein actually prevent you from entering ketosis completely even in the absence of dietary carbs? Or does it just reduce circulating ketones?\n\nI also struggle with determining what \"excess protein\" actually means, what amount is considered \"excess\" and is it even a practical level of intake? Why does the body override the regulation of GNG and use that \"excess\" to create unessary glucose rather than using it for anything else, or does it only do this if 100% of other uses for amino acids are satisfied?",
                "But the amount of GNG isnt that take away here it's that EGP was lower in the high protein zero carb group which is the concern for keto not the rate of GNG but the rate of glucose production. Who cares if more GNG occurred if it didn't lead to more glucose production Of course there is going to be more GNG on the low carb group because the demand for the body to produce its own glucose is higher, the Other group isconsuming 55% carbohydrates, the demand for EGP is lower.\n\nIf anything this just showed that the body controlled the amount of glucose it was producing in the H group instead of uncontrolled GNG dumping unneeded glucose into the system just because it had more amino acids.",

I've also seen people who claim to be following a strict keto diet for long periods of time who notice their circulating ketone level to drop to 0.3 regularly.\n\nCouldn't that also happen if the usage exceeds the generation of ketones?\n\nIf it really is as simple as dipping temporarily below 0.5 then simply existing, physical activity, prolonged periods of very low carb eating can all \"kick you out of ketosis\" \n\nDo people who eat moderate protein stay in what is considered ketosis 100% of the time or does it fluctuate throughout the day as people use and generate different levels of ketones?\n\nDoes protein intake simply down regulate ketogenesis or does it actually halt it all together to the point where if you continue to eat protein you would just never enter ketosis? If that's true the body would have to generate massive amounts of glucose in order to meet its demand.\n\nOn the supply versus demand driven argument, if you were too intake high amounts of protein and high amounts of carbohydrates would your body just continue to produce glucose from amino acids regardless of it being able to use them?"

It's interesting that the standard deviation for length of time on ketogenic diets was \\~25 months.\n\nThe discussion postulates increased GABA  as a primary mechanism underlying the observed effects but also noted conflicting literature related to increased GABA in ketogenic nutrition.\n\nThe authors also mention the role of cortisol regulation in the observed effect. Yes, we know initially cortisol tends to spike, but with continued time in ketosis and fat adaptation, cortisol tends to decrease - I believe HPA axis regulation is probably a key mechanism for the effects of ketogenic nutrition. Since salivary and serum cortisol rise acutely in response to stress, it might be interesting to look at other inflammatory cytokines and/or c-reactive protein in individuals on ketogenic plans vs standard American diets.\n\nAnecdotally, I have found similar positive alterations in mood, perceived psychological well-being, and perceived stress for the last 5 years eating strict keto with occasional 72-96 hour fasts. I transitioned to carnivore several months ago with occasional 72 hour fat fasts and the positive effect seems to have turned up another notch. Good times, for sure.\n\nThanks for posting this study.

                "So you may like to know that the receptor sites that Lithium latches onto are the same receptor site that Magnesium does. You may also like to know that Magnesium calms people down, and front I\u2019ve seen has a more obvious effect on those struggling with mood dysregulation. I think it\u2019s interesting that 85% of the population is deficient in magnesium, due to our dietary choices and farming practices that have lowered the nutrients in the soil (Food had much higher nutrition rates 50 years ago). I think you may also like to know that METHYLATED B-9/Folic acid is now being prescribed by some psychiatrists. Many of my PTSD, ADHD, and \u201cmoody\u201d friends get significant benefits from Methylated B-9, especially if they are taking 100-200% (its water-soluble, so as long as you don\u2019t exceed like 5-10x\u2019s the RDI amount, you should be good, you\u2019ll just pee it out). They also get significant benefits from Magnesium. Magnesium Glycinate is great because it gets inside the cells better, the Glycinate helps transport it. That form of Magnesium is also absorbed better,  less irritating to the stomach, and great for sleep. My son\u2019s psychiatrist prescribed Methylated B-9 and then he was able to get off his psych meds. I can tell just by looking at him if he has skipped more than 2 or 3 days. It\u2019s crazy. No side effects. Do be careful to not use more than 350 mg of Magnesium for adult women as it\u2019s a mineral and can build up in the body and eventually reach toxic levels, much like Lithium. Lot bigger range to get to that point though. Plus you\u2019d know, your blood pressure would get to dropping, feel woozy, etc.",
                "As far as I\u2019m aware there isn\u2019t. I\u2019m not 100 sure I\u2019m understanding you correctly. So I may be a bit redundant. I just meant that you can consume way more magnesium. Like a wider range of tolerability before anything bad. Unlike Lithium. The range of therapeutic is so much more narrow before toxicity as you know. Also Magnesium is like the third most used mineral or something. So like your body uses it for a ton of things, so I highly doubt it would mess up the Lithium. Although calcium regulation is related to bipolar or part of the proposed mechanism? And too much salt interferes with lithium (lithium salt). So can\u2019t say as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium are all electrolytes. It might make you need less Lithium if you are taking it though. Also I think there\u2019s another mineral that is needed to help stabilize calcium channel gates/flow. Like help regulates it. Boron? Potassium? I can\u2019t remember. Since you\u2019re going down the biohacking rabbit hole. Chris Palmer is doing multiple location study on mental illness with a fair percentage of them having bipolar. The results aren\u2019t totally in. However, it seems that about 2/3rds of his patient population experiences no need for drugs or a reduced amount as long as they stay in strict ketosis. The people who own Roblox, there son was not able to be functional till he started doing therapeutic keto with his meds. They are giving him at least partial funding or maybe all of it because they feel it\u2019s so important after there son\u2019s incredible improvement when he\u2019s exhausted all the other options and still wasn\u2019t functional. More research is showing mental illness is related to low-level brain inflammation. Also insulin surges. So you can have good blood glucose and a good hA1C, but still have insulin surges. Keto diet cuts out all but under 20g? Of carbs, so no insulin spike and keto cuts inflammation. So it makes sense. Clearly there\u2019s a third who have some other thing driving it, but no one has any clue yet."

                "Sadly, I've seen your comments being deleted for \"misinformation\" on r/keto. No matter what diet is or what aspect of it you discuss there is always a belief as if truth is completely known.\n\nI've been also thinking lately about gluconeogenic proteins in diet not without having the Bart Kay opinion on that. There are definitely amino-acids that scientists call glucogenic and ketogenic. And I generally can't see a problem for a body to use the resources it gets to get more energy. I don't know of any mechanism that converts proteins to fats. And considering that ketone bodies are made of fat and fat is a superior form of energy to store, then why wouldn't our bodies want to spare fats for using proteins as glucose that also can replete muscle glycogen stores.\n\nBart Kay generally calls out many people by saying that we aren't supposed to be in ketosis 24/7, and that insulin is required for normal body functions. If dietary protein cannot put you out of ketosis, then his whole point breaks, but I believe him and get his logic. So it's all still a belief system.",
                "But how can you even define that \"demand\"? The brain, for example, for sure doesn't have constant percentages of energy that it should get from glucose and ketone bodies, as well as other organs that require glucose. Even though RBC is more like a constant it's still not a number that our bodies can count somehow. How do you define the demand for muscle glycogen repletion? Shouldn't we have an easier time to be always ready for a fight?\n\nAlso, considering that protein can rise insulin, wouldn't it lower ketone production, meaning that the organism requires to change its fuel usage a bit, where protein to glucose conversion can be a way to go.\n\nSo, I don't believe in the concept of \"demand\" here.",
                "This article doesn't consider that glucose produced by gluconeogenesis can be stored as glycogen in the liver at all though. Yet I think it's the important detail in this talk",
                "It can obtain glycogen from fat but it also cannot and gets exogenous glucose, I suppose.\n\nAbout insulin/glucagon ratio I wouldn't tell you, but folks that eat fruits and call themselves keto or carnivore definitely love more insulin secretion, at least it's how they call it.\n\nDemand... I understand demand for overall energy, but when almost all parts of our bodies can get energy from different substrates you can't define demand for different macros. We aren't machines in which we can calculate required input for some work.\n\nStill, I think it's another misconception just like insulin-resistance. So many thoughts without actual analyses to inform us on those \"numbers\".",
                "Thank you very much. I wanted to answer the same thing about insulin promoting glycogen storage, but you did it much better than if I were to write it.\n\nI've been banned just now from r/keto for trying to defend OP against this \"demand\" driven thing. Ridiculous moderators, they call it \"misinformation\"",
                "Are you serious? Gluconeogenesis is happening in the liver, the liver can store glucose as glycogen. There is no need to pump it all into the blood, do you follow the logic?",

If muscle glycogen was getting repleted it would have been seen.\n\nSo, still, EGP for muscle glycogen would be seen, while liver glycogen stores are more important to be refilled as I understand it.",

                "How EGP is even measured? Is there even an accurate way to do it? It happens in the most coplicated human organ and besides that, the kidneys are also producing quite amount of glucose. I think it's all some mystery talks.\n\nAnd why exactly depletion of liver glycogen is required for ketosis? Diabetics produce ketones with full liver glycogen. What's the mechanism that depletion affects it? Doesn't insulin/glucagon ratio only affect that? Without exogenous carbs glucagon is considerable signal hormoe in healthy people.",
                "Also, why do reference the book of neither scientist or doctor?",
                "What do you mean it doesn't need to? Our bodies still require glucose. By conversion of protein to glucose we can store excess glucose as glycogen. I can't see a hole in my idea. Or do you think that only exogenous carbs can be stored as glycogen?\n\nThere is no talk about efficiency, when we are talking about things that keep us alive. Even if true carnivores can make glucose three times more efficiently from protein than us, it still makes no sense to do nothing with nutrients that we eat. Protein isn't fiber, we can digest it, we can get energy out of it.",
                ">Which excess is that?\n\nAny amount that is more than it's needed to be secreted into the blood, I suppose.\n\n>If we have liver glycogen, the liver will downregulate gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis.\n\nI think your assumption wrong, I mean pancreas hormones control what our liver should do. Insulin says to all body that it is fed, that it should get nutrients from the food and to store the excess. You yourself put the cart before the horse.\n\n>Well yeah, as liver glycogen. That's basic biology.\n\nAre you a biochemist to say that outright?)\n\nRead the admin comment here that says that gluconeogenesis is supply driven just like lypogenesis and glycogenesis are supply driven. My assumptions in his view are correct. Insulin here is the key, and how you can forget it, is very important question. Belief, I suppose",
                "You're still not following the logic. The body requires to make use of extra amino-acids, it doesn't matter that there would be little amounts of liver glycogen at all, considering also that glucose is always going out of the liver, and that gluconeogenesis is always occuring process in the liver, the question is just how much.\n\nI haven't seen any strong evidence in that study that 33% of energy was gotten out of amino-acids, they didn't measure liver glycogen level even, where the other big amount of energy just were left for future use.\n\nThere is no correlation at all between gluconeogenesis and level of liver glycogen stores. Diabetics are always in gluconeogenesis mode, yet their liver glycogen are full. Hormones tell what the liver supposed to do, not the amount of storage. The amount of storage produces effect surely in adipose tissue that create HORMONE called leptin to tell the body about it.\n\nIn this study of diabetic rats they had full liver glycogen: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26521055/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26521055/)",
                "So, you're saying that we can't have both hormones working at the same time. On and off switch? But it is ridiculous, we have both of there hormones in our blood all the time be it a fast or a fed state. The liver can both be creating glucose and glycogen out of protein, and at the same time releasing already stored glycogen, or create glucose out of glycerol, it can do many things at the same time! Do you know how much space the liver takes in our bodies even?\n\nAs I understood it, you haven't even read the article that was posted here by one of the admins. If you have read it, you could have find this study, in which it is clearly shown that food intake of either fat or protein increases both insulin and glucagon in pretty equal amounts: [Incretin and islet hormonal responses to fat and protein ingestion in healthy men | American Journal of Physiology-Endocrinology and Metabolism](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.90233.2008)\n\nLearn to think out of the box, or at least learn to study your opponents arguements, before making counter-arguements",
                "You are truly ridiculous, aren't you. I have just said to you that the liver is pretty huge organ, and you still haven't taken that into your false equation. Or even that protein can't fill whole liver with glycogen on a ketogenic diet in almost all circumstances. The hormones are the ones that tell the liver to do such things as storage or release, yet you think that they have any idea of what is stored or what is going on in millions of its cells.\n\nSurely on a carbohydrate rich diet your liver is having good amounts of glycogen, not just because of carbohydrates, but also because of big insulin responces that carbs do to us. You are still thinking from that perspective. Yet when we eat proteins and fats without carbs, both insulin and glucagon are in place to deal with all the food and keep the blood sugar in normal range at the same time.\n\nInsulin provide glucose and amino-acids to cells, decreasing the sugar lever, that's one point. Glucagon tells the cells in the liver it binded to produce glucose, the other cells that got insulin receptor activated can easily take up glucose from it's neighboring cell to store it for later without even leaving of glucose out of the liver. For some unknown reason you think of the liver as a huge cell that can do either this or that. Yet it is million cells that can do both metabolic processes at the same time unlike in cases of huge insulenima on a carb-rich diet.\n\nOr perhaps you didn't know that cells don't comminicate on psychic level and only do things when their specific receptors are activated by spefic things?",

                "Specification analysis is a pretty modern statistical analysis tool. The idea is that when you analyze data, you are building a statistical model that you then (typically) perform a hypothesis test on. One assumption of hypothesis tests (i.e. the things that generate a p value that we use to make a decision) is that your model is an accurate-enough representation of the process that generated your data (i.e. how things work in real life), and if it's not then your model is mis-specified or in other words you don't have the right combination of predictor variables to appropriately predict what you want and all your results are wrong.\n\nOk, enough about the mechanics of specification analysis, back up a level - why? There's a tongue-in-cheek term called researcher degrees of freedom to explain part of the 'reproducibility crisis' in science. Essentially, if you give 100 scientists the exact same data set, they'll come 200 different results and interpretations. This doesn't mean anyone's doing anything wrong or bad, just that there's a lot of options. An important concept in stats is not just what you think the summary statistic is, but how sure you are of that result. For simple truly random data, we know how to estimate that false positive rate just with some math. But with something as complex as human free will we need to do simulations to understand what the true distribution of that curve looks like so that we can estimate the false positive rate, which is essentially what specification analysis is doing. The core question is 'given the entire distribution of options and results, how likely is it that you would get your result just by dumb luck?' \n\nBringing it back to this paper, it answers nothing about whether meat is healthy or not. You explicitly cannot draw a conclusion either way from this analysis because it just doesn't ask that question. Instead it says, \"look at all these results - if researchers were making truly unbiased, random choices in their analysis then we would expect to see this distribution of results reported\". If the results reported do not match that distribution, it does not mean anyone is guilty of misconduct, or being bought off, or having an agenda, because there's perfectly logical reasons for those results to be reported. It simply means that maybe someone should take a closer look at what's going on to understand why those choices are being made because right now there's experts who don't understand why some choices are less common even though they're just as reasonable."

                "I am upset that r/keto changed so much. I first started in that sub in 2010, and everyone was so great.  The idea back then was that most people actually consumed a bit more calories than the regular BMR calculators would suggest.  No one was rabidly chanting CICO, there was healthy discussion and debate, or at least as healthy as it ever is on Reddit.\n\nFor myself, I failed dozens of times, throughout my 20s to lose weight and keep it off via calorie reduction.  My body seems to be happy at 360lbs.  Regular dieting got me down to 320 then I'd stall every time.\n\nMy BMR was around 2500 kcal IIRC.  When I started keto, aiming for 20g carbs, my daily calorie goal went up to 2850 kcal.  Using those numbers, over the next year, I lost 100lbs.\n\nUnfortunately, even though I increased my exercise, even doing CrossFit, and kept to my macros; the weight came back after about five years.\n\nAll that is to say that:\n\nA) If CICO was so easy, and something something law of thermodynamics, then why would I die if I drank motor oil for my calories?  Or ate wood chips?  If you put motor oil and or wood chips into a bomb calorimeter, they burn and release energy.  So, obviously there are more factors then calories, and also talking about laws of thermodynamics in relation to weight loss is just stupid.\n\nB) That WP article was just an opinion piece.  The author has all kinds of them, one was titled something like Calories In Calories Out is the only thing that matters in weight loss, so I guess they're an r/keto mod.  Maybe that mod literally linked their own opinion article as proof.\n\nThe article is suspect.  The first study they link to disprove the Metabolic downturn from weight loss was a study of a handful of women that lost something like 6lbs on average.  Since that weight loss didn't cause big metabolic changes, then obviously losing 50x more weight must be exactly the same.\n\nC) Between the various weight loss databases and the biggest loser study, I'm not sure why it's so hard to accept that for some people, long term weight loss might not be in the cards, save for using surgical interventions I suppose.  \n\nSurgical interventions and even just being constantly stressed about being overweight have their own health impacts.  So maybe there's a dividing line somewhere where is actually better to just be happy and fat.  Personally my blood pressure, cholesterol, AC1/blood sugar, etc are perfectly fine for a 40 year old man.  My arteries are free of plaque, and my weight doesn't stop me from doing anything I want to do.  So if no reasonable weight loss strategy works, I'm left to wonder if I shouldn't just keep active, and not pay attention to my weight.\n\nThat's my rant anyways, it sort of got away from me. Wow."

My mum who is 43 has \u2018better\u2019 markers than you and she isn\u2019t on keto, she has a much higher HDL:Tri ratio, so all of that I think is actually a load of baloney that people say to justify an extreme diet. That said, it\u2019s how you feel, if you feel good then don\u2019t question it. However, it\u2019s more about the quality of what you\u2019re consuming and the wholeness of it rather than your lipid markers. You could have these lipid markers if you were eating just one McDonald\u2019s a day below 1500 calories as long as you were burning the carbs consumed your triglycerides would be low anyway. But we know a McDonald\u2019s a day isn\u2019t healthy. \n\nTo sum up, if you feel good then it\u2019s working and if you\u2019re consuming whole foods then don\u2019t stress. I am keto and have similar lipid markers, and I believed in the link between keto and lipid markers and the gospel of HDL:Tri ratios but then like I said my mum has better lipid markers than us both and she doesn\u2019t diet so its a load of toss to base your predicted health outcomes off lipid tests. This is literally the argument we use against statins, and we say that high cholesterol doesn\u2019t correspond with this or that, and the reverse also applies, cholesterol will change depending on your diet and so the food you eat is the important part, not the outcome of your lipids after the food you eat..",

However, looking at the study for xanthomas you\u2019ve supplied, they actually found that linoleic acid is lowest in xanthomas and highest in atherosclerotic plaques the same as free cholesterol molecules. Oleic acid is highest in the xanthomas and lowest in arterial plaques. \n\nThis suggests that it is free cholesterol that causes the xanthomas and not linoleic acid as there is an inverse relationship 0.36 linoleic acid: oleic acid within xanthomas. \n\nObviously my mum\u2019s cholesterol is pathogenic as she has the xanthelasma under her eye, but her lipid profile would convey a healthy and non-pathogenic lipid type hence my confusion and post? :)"

Beyond my expertise and attention span, though: I studied statistics in college but that was about 5 decades ago.\n\n> Conclusion  \nThe recent Western dietary change, mainly the massive increase in refined carbohydrate consumption, has well described adverse health consequences. Traits not under medical competence but still with large social importance seem also impacted, such as facial attractiveness. Facial attractiveness, an important factor of social interactions, seems to be impacted by immediate and chronic refined carbohydrate consumption. Further studies are needed to investigate how diet effects are mediated and which other social traits could be affected by refined carbohydrate consumption.\n\nTL;DR: The keto diet may make people more attractive because it avoids both hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia because it provides relatively flat, steady blood sugar levels, compared to the typical high-carb diet.

The secondary objectives were to compare the impact of the two diets on quality of life (QoL) and investigate potential associations of changes in pain with changes in body weight, body composition, and ketosis.\n\nMethods: Adult female patients with lipedema and obesity were randomized to either the LCD or control diet (energy prescription: 1200 kcal/day) for 8 weeks. Body weight and body composition, pain (Brief Pain Inventory measured pain), and QoL (RAND 36-Item Health Survey [RAND-36], Impact of Weight on Quality of Life [IWQOL]-Lite, and Lymphoedema Quality of Life [LYMQOL]) were measured at baseline and at postintervention.\n\nResults: A total of 70 female patients (age, mean [SD], 47 [11] years; BMI 37 [5] kg/m2) were included. The LCD group had greater weight loss (-2.8 kg; 95% CI: -4.1 to -1.0; p < 0.001) and larger reduction in pain now (-1.1; 95% CI: -1.9 to -0.3; p = 0.009) compared with the control group. No association was found between changes in pain now and weight loss. Both groups experienced improvements in several QoL dimensions.\n\nConclusions: Diet-induced weight loss in women with lipedema can improve QoL. An energy-restricted LCD seems to be superior to a standard control diet in reducing pain",

                "Your cholesterol is high. Statins are probably a good idea, as they prevent further plaque from building up in your arteries, which is what kills you eventually with cholesterol issues.\n\nAs far as nutrition, here's what we know,\n\nYou can eat a diet high in carbs if that's what you prefer. If you choose to do that, eating a diet low in red meat and low in high cholesterol foods is probably a good idea based on the current data.\n\nIf you're like me and prefer red meat and high cholesterol foods, it has been shown in the data that if you eat low carb (ketogenic) then a diet high in red meat and higher cholesterol foods has the reverse effect and actually improves your lipid numbers. \n\nI took that and ran with it, been on carnivore since July of last year, have the healthiest lipid numbers I've had in my life, and am happier than I've been in a long time.",
                ">statins are not going to benefit you one bit.\n\nSource? \n\nStatins will prevent further plaque from building up in the arteries. I don't agree with anything else that doctor said, but statins may not be a bad idea.",
                "Age factors less into it than time with high cholesterol. Over time, cholesterol forms plaque in the arteries, which causes blockages. That plaque has multiple methods by which it harms you. Tonprevent that plaque from continuing to build, one employs statins.",
                "You mean, people who use evidence-based logic to make their decisions?",
                ">You are assuming there is a build up of plaque. Statins don\u2019t actually prevent plaque build up, they stabilize existing plaque by calcifying it. If you don\u2019t have plaque you don\u2019t want to calcify and harden your arteries, as that is actually a form of heart disease.\n\nLength of time for elevated cholesterol is what determines whether or not she has plaque build up. I understand the mechanism of plaque prevention, I didn't feel it was necessary to get into the minutiae of how ststins work. My explanation certainly was factual. It does prevent a further buildup as new plaque cannot form.\n\n>To date, none of the large trials of secondary prevention with statins has shown a reduction in overall mortality in women. ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9416884))\n\nThat is not at all what that study says. The conclusion:\n\n>Cholesterol lowering with simvastatin produced similar reductions in relative risk for major coronary events in women compared with men and in elderly (> or = 65 years of age) compared with younger patients. There were too few female deaths to assess the effects on mortality in women. Because mortality rates increased substantially with age, the absolute risk reduction for both all-cause and CHD mortality in simvastatin-treated subjects was approximately twice as great in the older patients.\n\nIt states that the risk factors *did* lower for women the same as they did for men. It also says there weren't enough deaths to evaluate the effect on mortality rates in women. That is not the same as not showing a reduction as you falsely imply.\n\n>Perhaps more critically, the primary prevention trials have shown neither an overall mortality benefit, nor even a reduction in cardiovascular end points in women. ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15138247))\n\nThat's also not what that study is saying. Why are you attempting to sway people to do things that are bad for them by misrepresenting data? You are either a terrible human or terrible at interpreting results. Either way, you should stop giving advice based on your erroneous interpretations. The conclusion:\n\n>For women without cardiovascular disease, lipid lowering does not affect total or CHD mortality. Lipid lowering may reduce CHD events, but current evidence is insufficient to determine this conclusively. For women with known cardiovascular disease, treatment of hyperlipidemia is effective in reducing CHD events, CHD mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization, but it does not affect total mortality.\n\nThe actual interpretation is far more nuanced than you imply. One, this study is looking at people with coronary heart disease. Not the general population or even a population with just elevated lipids, so taking this study and attempting to apply it to the broad swath of the population is intellectually dishonest.\n\nThen, those *without* CVD and with CHD don't appear to achieve any reduction in *CHD* mortality to lowering their lipid levels, with CVD, they do, though total mortality is not lowered in the population *with CHD* and CVD.\n\nYour application of this study to a person who is part of the general population is flawed at best and intentionally destructive at worst.",

What BDH and OXCT do together is convert beta-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) into acetyl-coa.  Acetyl-coa can only produce ATP in the CTA cycle.   So these are cells that contain intact mitochondrial cristae.\n\nAnd/or the generation of acetyl-coa can be used to synthesize acyl-coa or in other words, fatty acids which can be used for cellular construction.  For cell proliferation you need not just energy but also construct cell material out of fats and proteins to form nuclei, DNA, cell wall, organelles etc..\n\nHow I interpret this is that the cells are grown under poor conditions which impairs their growth rate.  Adding any missing source of carbon or amino acids will assist in speeding up the growth.\n\nIf I'm not interpreting it wrong, you can see in [figure 1F](https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016109#Fig1) of the following [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016109) the relative reduction in growth.\n\nThe paper does not clarify which nutrients are deprived so we can't know for sure.

For the starvation they leave this out.  They added L and R-beta-hydroxybutyrate at 10mM and 25mM.  In fact it is a bit confusing.  They point to R in the title but in section 2.1 they say L-(R)-\n\n-> the concentration is very high.  This may reflect better the conditions under ketoacidosis than under nutritional ketosis\n\n-> They used both [L and R](https://socratic.org/questions/what-do-l-d-r-and-s-in-enantiomers-stand-for) form.  Our bodies naturally produce the L (or D) form.  We don't know here how much of the effect is due to L or R.\n\nTo further attest the importance of the starvation and concentration, the paper itself mentions the following:\n\n>It is important to mention that the induction of proliferation was \u03b2-HB concentration-dependent in SW 1353 cells under starvation conditions because, **at 1 and 2.5 mM, the proliferation index did not differ significantly from the starvation group** (Fig. S1).\n\nFigure 1A confirms my info above, the starvation greatly reduces the proliferation and the addition of 10 or 25mM only partially corrects the normal proliferation rate under starvation conditions.  And as the quote shows, under normal nutritional 3HB concentration it does not support proliferation.\n\nImportant, that lack of effect at 1 and 2.5 mM could be partially because of the L and R mixed form.  Somewhere between 2.5 and 10 mM there must be a change in effect.",

Proliferation requires material.  Cancer cells can also utilize glucose to produce fatty acids via acetyl-coa overproduction.  Using 3HB to produce fatty acids then saves glucose for ATP production.\n\nThere are also multiple mitochondria in a cell so there could be a situation where there is partly normal mitochondria and partially supporting cancer.  \n\nWe always need to be careful with the cell line because abnormalities could become part of immortalized cell lines for research.\n\nWhen it is in vitro cancer research, it's interesting read but I wouldn't hold my breath over it.",

The group with High LDL-C, low VLDL-C has an average LDL-C of 123 mg/dL.  This is far from the levels that we see in LMHR's where we see values double and more compared to this group.\n2. In support of the first point, if you look at the number of people within this group then we find that almost 50% of the total is within this group.  So in effect it is more representative of the average population.\n3. Because of point 2, we have to consider that the other 3 groups are deviations from the average and therefor may represent a larger proportion of people with medical issues.  The low levels of LDL-C of 83.4 and 77.8 in the groups Low LDL-C, low VLDL-C and low LDL-C and high VLDL-C are, to my view, representing groups that are receiving medical treatment at a higher proportion.\n4. There is a u-shaped correlation with all cause mortality in the population on a standard diet of which the reported LDL-C levels are near what the following study reported [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209592732300347X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209592732300347X)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7q7odgseyewc1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7622a297ebd4efc45f3ba8db411e8ba7562150\n\nIf we hail the results then we aught to apply the findings straight onto the population following a ketogenic diet. This would mean that we have to recognize this u-shaped curve and consider levels of 200 and above equally or more at risk of all-cause mortality.\n\nClearly, the chosen cut-off points for the groups already influences the results.  Create different criteria and you'll find the numbers shift unsurprisingly.  What is perhaps most important in this study is the rationale for these groups.\n\n>The study cohort was categorized into concordant and discordant pairs using clinically standard optimal levels: <100 mg/dL for LDL\u2010C and <30\u2009mg/dL for VLDL\u2010C.[^(7)](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.123.031878#jah39411-bib-0007)^(,)\u00a0[^(8)](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.123.031878#jah39411-bib-0008)\n\nSo what is really meaningful is that those who achieve this definition are not the ones who have the best outcomes.  That is for me the only hard conclusion that can be made.\n\nAs such, I find the results intriguing and interesting but non-conclusive on any benign or protective effect on a ketogenic diet.",
                "That's part of what I'm pointing out.  If you look at the low LDL-C groups, they have 32.4% and 53.1% lipid lowering therapy, compared to 17.7% for the biggest group.  So due to the lipid lowering therapy, those that would otherwise fall into the high LDL-C category are now moved into the low category.  This means we're comparing apples with oranges.\n\nOne other factor for survival is the age.  The older you are, the more likely you'll suffer harder and risk death in case of an event.  We see that the high LDL-C, low VLDL-C has the lowest percentage in the age group 70 and upwards.  So just based on age itself, you'd expect this group to do better.",

                "No LDL is not bad.  LDL can contribute to the worsening of the condition but and varying aspects of LDL can contribute more but it doesn't mean that LDL is the sole factor.  There is no such thing evidenced so far that just having high LDL causes atherosclerosis (ASCVD).  Not even in people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).  In those with FH who do die early of ASCVD, they have other factors that worsen their condition faster which is related to clotting.\n\nClotting is the final plug in the narrowed pipeline that triggers an event.  The narrowing however is the result of damage to the lining of the artery.  That lining gets fixed by a new layer of cells which makes the arterial wall thicker.  That thicker wall however now is at risk of hypoxia.  The cells in that area will produce signaling molecules (cytokines) to resolve this.\n\nI'm speculating but hypoxic areas are ideal for anaerobic bacteria.  Whether this is the cause or purely the cytokines.. macrophages come to the problematic area.  Macrophages will take up lipids (LDL particles).  Primarily oxidized LDLs.  The reason for becoming oxidized is due to diet but also again bacteria so macrophages take them up and strip apart the LDL particles to reuse the lipids for energy.\n\nAll these steps would resolve the situation just fine as it is in fact a (high level) description of the healing process but if the environment (high carb high sugar high insulin) is unfavorable then that healing process is not perfect and may just lead to a worsening condition over time.\n\nEither way, if you look into the whole process in more detail then the role of LDL only becomes smaller and eventually minimal at most.  There are sufficient papers to cast doubt on the benefits of cholesterol lowering drugs.  Positive results that are achieved are either achieved through nice tricks or could be explained by additional properties of the drugs which only help in delaying an event.

Glucose did not drop but circulating NEFA did drop.

This is also clear from their baseline blood glucose and baseline insulin.\n\nSo what likely happened is that the rise in insulin before the glucose was ingested, primed the uptake of glucose into various cells (probably mostly adipose and muscle).  Keep in mind that for muscle cells insulin stimulates GLUT4 expression which increases glucose uptake.

A doubling to 20 mU/L is not to be neglected.  Insulin has a logarithmic effect. And we see here for the lean meat that insulin stays elevated for at least 3 hours while for fat it already starts to subside as of around 45 minutes.\n\nSecondly, the test meals were liquid for carbs and fat while it was a real piece of meat for the protein.  This resulted in the ingestion of 100g of pure glucose, 87ml of fat and 352 gr of grilled lean turkey.\n\nThe liquid form for glucose and fat makes them absorb very fast and thus exaggerate the insulin response.\n\nThe dry lean turkey is hard to eat without any sauce or anything to help mastication.  In addition digestion will be affected by the ingestion of the water which dilutes the digestion enzymes.  This is not applicable to the glucose meal.\n\nIt is OK to isolate items and see how they affect the insulin response but one should also understand how powerful insulin is at any given level.

                "I started carnivore, only because of my clusterattacks. My LDL is sky high. Though HDL normal and tryglicerides low. If i still had as many clusterattacks as 3 years ago, i would rather kill myself. The fact is that all markers improved and also my health improved:\n\n* clusterattacks reduced by more then 2 times. Coming from 14 attacks each month, now only 1 each month on average by also adding magic mushrooms.\n* severe nightly leg cramps: gone. First became worse, probably because of oxalate dumping.\n* waking up with my heart in my throat: gone\n* waking up with acid reflux: gone\n* eye sight: improved on both eyes with 1,00\n* gums improved\n* mental clarity: improved\n* insulin resistance: gone\n* 20 years of acne: gone\n* polycistic kidneys: improved ( i thought it would be worse, as the nephrologist in the hospital said it would. As the homedoctor said it would. As the dietician said it would. Not the case/. I later saw a video from dr. youtube Ken Berry claiming exactly this would happen. And it did with me.)\n* galbladder polyps: shrunk\n\nAnd i forget some things, but it's massive. So yeah, there is a niche if u ask me. No doctor or specialist could answer on my clusterattacks. Pills only made it worse. And i was as good as vegan for years and years. Never ate much meat in the first place. Makes me wonder, also considering the oxalate dumping: is vegan diet a healthy diet. May this be endorced according to your vision? And is carnivore/keto really off the chards if vegan/vegetarian/SAD ain't? SAD meaning you consume sugar, processed foods, vegetable oils, grains and others.\n\nAlso i'd like your view on this: when you eat Oreo cookies for 2 weeks, your LDL will go low. So if you don't say a thing; the doctor would bloodtest your LDL and say: your fine now, continue your way. So you can live your life eating tons of Oreo cookies. You don't need statins anymore. Doesn't make sense does it?",
                "So your saying SAD diet/Vegan/vegetarian is better? Really?",
                "Medicin can harm though, and there is not much around it, to register. They rather sell meds then report that people got tons of horrible side-effects. Like heart palpitations/severe fatique/spontenious blisters.\n\nI beg to disagree. Follow evidence-based guidelines, only worked for Big Pharma, to sell tons of sjit meds. But yes, best is under medical supervision. I'm advised to take statins though. You know what statins do right: lower k2, which induces the very thing you want to prevent. Also there are statins that lower cholesterol in your brain. You don't want that, right?\n\nClean eating will help, i agree on that 2. Carnivore helps me, because i'm in ketosis. When i'm out: then i will get more clusterattacks and cannot resolve it by taking a microdose of magic truffles. Problem is, without meat, it's as good as impossible to be in ketosis. And ketosis is where all the fun stuff starts to happen.",
                "Lots of wrong research/data about the mediterrranean diet. But i would instantly agree that this is better then SAD/vegan or vegetarian. Better then carnivore: i highly doubt it. That's my personal opinion, based on all the data/research i've seen and my personal experience.\n\nI still think carnivore is better then what most people are eating. I'm sure Dave Feldman will do a peer-reviewed research on keto soon (most are eating carnivore). The first outcomes are already amazing for people like you, probably.",
                "There already have been tons of CT, CAC scans and more scans, for people who are on carnivore/keto more then 10 years. If you are in \"the scene\" you see it happening before your eyes. As good as all of them report zero scores. So i can guese where this research will land.\n\nOf course, all persons are different, so you should always check up things before doing it and also after doing it. In my case; i have no other choice or i will get tons of clusterheadaches again. So i will stay on this road. If it would turn out to be bad, maybe i'll reconsider my position, but i would not abandon low carb/low bloodsugar. At least all bloodmarkers improved, echo showed improvement and my health is tons better. But of course this doesn't say i will never get atherosclerosis. Then again, end of 2020 i was as good as broken. I really think i would have died if i continued that way. Waking up mostly with my heart in my troath, gasping for air. So i see every year i have as a win. I dunno what all was wrong in my body. But it certainly was hell.",

It's not clear what the limit is, however, or whether the limit is fixed. \n\nThe body can send excess amino acids into gluconeogenesis or it can burn them directly in the Kreb's cycle. Good luck figuring out how that decision is made.\n\nPeople with fatty liver have broken regulation of gluconeogenesis - that's what leads to the hyperinsulinemia that characterizes insulin resistance. Different degrees of fatty liver likely have different levels of gluconeogenesis. \n\nPeople eat different levels of carbs on keto, and there's probably a genetic component as well. And different people have different levels and kinds of exercise, which influences glucose burn.\n\nBecause of all those factors I don't believe there is one answer.

We enumerated all defensible combinations of analytic choices to produce a comprehensive list of all the ways in which the data may reasonably be analyzed. We applied specification curve analysis to data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 to 2014 to investigate the effect of unprocessed red meat on all-cause mortality. The specification curve analysis used a random sample of all reasonable analytic specifications we sourced from primary studies.\n\n### Results\n\nAmong 15 publications reporting on 24 cohorts included in the systematic review on red meat and all-cause mortality, we identified 70 unique analytic methods, each including different analytic models, covariates, and operationalizations of red meat (eg, continuous vs quantiles). We applied specification curve analysis to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, including 10,661 participants. Our specification curve analysis included 1208 unique analytic specifications, of which 435 (36.0%) yielded a hazard ratio equal to or more than 1 for the effect of red meat on all-cause mortality and 773 (64.0%) less than 1. The specification curve analysis yielded a median hazard ratio of 0.94 (interquartile range: 0.83\u20131.05). Forty-eight specifications (3.97%) were statistically significant, 40 of which indicated unprocessed red meat to reduce all-cause mortality and eight of which indicated red meat to increase mortality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe show that the application of specification curve analysis to nutritional epidemiology is feasible and presents an innovative solution to analytic flexibility.",

                "I am not a cgm expert, but my understanding is that they generate HbA1c comparable averages.\n\nAnd you could also apply glucose tolerance test standards using them.\n\nBoth of those are far more valuable diagnostically than fbg.",

                "I think the real answer is that we don't know. There's a lean hyper-responder trial going on right now - search for Dave Feldman to find out more - that may give answers for a subset. One problem we have is that keto is a relatively new diet and there's not enough of us to show up in the large data sets. \n\nMuch of the belief that LDL is bad comes from the statin trials, but the problem is that statins have other effects than lowering LDL. \n\nTwo thoughts:\n\nIf you want a good exploration of the alternate hypothesis, read Malcolm Kendrick's \"the clot thickens\". My personal opinion is that his theory is likely right, but you should make your own decision.\n\nThe focus on LDL is, at best, short-sighted. The statin trials have shown some modest reductions in heart disease among some populations, but they have been modest - perhaps a 30% reduction. \n\nThe effect of type II diabetes on heart disease risk is well studied, and it's somewhere in the range of 2x-4x. So focusing on LDL makes little sense when half the adult US population is either prediabetic or has type II - if you can fix the insulin resistance behind type II you will have more impact than reducing LDL. Not to mention statins increase the risk of type II. \n\nBut statins are hugely popular drugs that make ridiculous amounts of money for pharma, so we're stuck with fixating on LDL.",
                "Malcolm Kendrick talks about this in his blog and in \"the clot thickens\"...\n\nStatins increase the production of nitric oxide and that reduces endothelial disfunction. Which is a truly obvious way in which they could reduce the incidence of arterial disease which involves endothelial disfunction. \n\nThis is all very well researched and not at all controversial, but pretty much totally ignored because it's all about the LDL.",

                "Based on the underlying physiology - and a lot of anecdotal data - I don't think keto is necessarily the best approach for athletes when it comes to performance\n\nBut the data against it is painfully poor. The biggest problem is that you are taking athletes who are nearly all used to a high carb diet and putting them on a keto diet for a short period of time. It should surprise nobody with even a basic understanding of exercise physiology that this will reduce in reduced performance. Aerobic adaptations are well-established to be long-term adaptations - it's not uncommon for base training periods to be months in length. \n\nThe other problems I have is they have a small perspective on what drives sport performance. \n\nIn cycling - and some other sports - body weight is very important. Most teams use some sort of glucose-depleted training to help with that, which is the same sort of adaptation you get on a low carb diet. It's not a power adaptation, it's a weight adaptation. I don't know if I'm more or less powerful on a low carb diet, but it's really obvious that I climb better at 160 lbs than I do at 180 lbs. \n\nThe other issue is fueling. Many endurance athletes who do longer events have significant fueling issues because they are trying to process huge amounts of glucose into their systems to keep their performance up. They bonk, they have the dreaded \"GI issues\", they aren't confident in their approach. Driving more energy from fat helps a lot.\n\nThe final issue is pure health. Lots of us older athletes - like Noakes himself - have ended up pretty insulin resistant following the recommended \"healthy athlete\" diet.",
                "A response that says, \"that study was debunked\" is generally not a scientific one, because studies aren't generally debunked.\n\nStudies have strengths and weaknesses, some are good and some are poor, but the biggest problem is misinterpretion of results, often by the researchers themselves or their products teams.\n\nI'll also note that a mainstream source like wapo is not a great source for that sort of discussion.\n\nIn this case, tell us what you think the study shows and how you think that applies to a broader context.",
                "Thanks.\n\nThere are two big problems with studies like these. \n\nFirst, they generally only look at weight and therefore they don't account for differences in lean mass. If your diet tears down a lot of lean mass, then your BMR is obviously going to go down.\n\nSecond, they aren't looking at insulin resistance and the effect of that on BMR and fuel partitioning.

The increased HDL will naturally lower the LDL by assisting the Liver in metabolizing the LDL more efficiently. LDL means Low density, so it\u2019s typically stored in the arteries, under muscle and around the organs, which makes it dangerous as it\u2019s not readily used as fuel , just as HDL ( high density) is. \nI did my thesis on keto in my food science undergrad, and frankly it\u2019s a hit and miss, simply because most people don\u2019t know what they are doing. They are consuming excess amounts of animal products (dairy and meat) , restricting the other necessary macro and micronutrients and slowly degrading and destroying their organs from the inside out. Not only that but restricting their body of necessary nutrients and disrupting their natural biochemical mechanisms for things to function accordingly. \nI agree keto is beneficial on and off when eating a natural whole food and plant based diet, while still making sure the body is getting its necessary nutrients, removing highly acidic and processed foods. It has  been shown to lower risk of nervous system disorders, because of the removal of excess simple sugars, in which feed candida, increase amyloid production in the brain and that good old bad bacteria in the intestinal tract, causing all sorts of issues. \nAlthough, if you were to simply remove processed sugars from the body and replace complex and simple sugars with natural sugars such high fibre fruit, the story in how to body detoxifies lipids and toxins through the liver differs and what is a healthy diet shifts and changes, because then you are supporting and helping your organs such as the pancreas, liver , kidneys , and colon out.\nHowever, every persons biochemical makeup differs, lifestyle factors, genetics , blood type, all come in to play . \nListen to the scientists that have studied nutritional sciences, food science, biochemistry, anatomy, holistic nutrition, food microbiology, food chemistry, and that participate and follow research funded by non profits, and universities and that receive grants. Stay away from research funded by government self focus, food companies, meaning, the outcome of their research bring them more money by proving a food that can be readily sold to the public.

A recent analysis of the studies included in this review found that 88% did\u00a0not\u00a0support a link between these fats and heart disease \\[33\u25aa\u25aa\\]. Due to a new rule introduced by the USDA for this guidelines process, the 2020 DGAC was not allowed to examine external review papers and was therefore unable to consider any of the approximately 20 review papers described above. Top experts in the field attempted to introduce this evidence via written comments submitted formally to the USDA \\[33\u25aa\u25aa\\], in addition to meeting with the relevant senior staff members at both HHS and USDA, and submitting a letter to members of Congress \\[49\\]. Among the external review papers was now a 2021 \u2018State of the Art Review,\u2019 in the highly regarded\u00a0Journal of the American College of Cardiology\\[15\\], whose authors included 4 members of previous DGACs and which found that there is \u2018no robust evidence that current population-wide arbitrary upper limits on saturated fat consumption in the United States will prevent cardiovascular disease or reduce mortality.\u2019 The paper was named one of the top 100 articles of 2021 by the journal's editor in chief \\[50\\], yet this and other reviews were ultimately not considered in the 2020 DGAC review on saturated fats. The DGAC final report makes no mention of any shift in scientific thinking on these fats and concludes that the evidence linking them to heart disease is \u2018strong.\u2019\n\n>An analysis of the 2020 DGAC subcommittee in charge of the saturated fat review found numerous intellectual, financial, and even religious conflicts of interest that may have contributed to a bias against saturated fats \\[51,52\u25aa\u25aa\\]. For instance, one member was found to have chaired five vegetarian conferences from 1997 to 2018, which might reflect a bias against saturated fats, since a more liberal policy towards these fats would inevitably allow for greater consumption of animal foods. This member was also found to have been receiving funds from seven soy and tree nut industry groups, which stand to benefit commercially when guidelines favor the type of fats (polyunsaturated) commonly found in these foods. Another member had spent the last 50\u200ayears of her career working as a lead investigator on some of the government's largest trials attempting to show that fat and saturated fats are bad for health. A third member is part of a vegetarian activist group which has condemned the evolving science on saturated fats \\[53\\].

                "Abstract:\n>Fatty acids have been shown to modulate glucose metabolism in vitro and in vivo. However, there is still a need for substantial evidence and mechanistic understanding in many cell types whether both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (SFAs and UFAs) pose a similar effect and, if not, what determines the net effect of fatty acid mixes on glucose metabolism. In the present study, we asked these questions by treating granulosa cells (GCs) with the most abundant non-esterified fatty acid species in bovine follicular fluid. Results revealed that oleic and alpha-linolenic acids (UFAs) significantly increased glucose consumption compared to palmitic and stearic acids (SFAs). A significant increase in lactate production, extracellular acidification rate, and decreased mitochondrial activity indicate glucose channeling through aerobic glycolysis in UFA treated GCs. We show that insulin independent glucose transporter GLUT10 is essential for UFA driven glucose consumption, and the induction of AKT and ERK signaling pathways necessary for GLUT10 expression. To mimic the physiological conditions, we co-treated GCs with mixes of SFAs and UFAs. Interestingly, co-treatments abolished the UFA induced glucose uptake and metabolism by inhibiting AKT and ERK phosphorylation and GLUT10 expression. These data suggest that the net effect of fatty acid induced glucose uptake in GCs is determined by SFAs under physiological conditions.",
                "Abstract:\n>DHA is abundant in brain where it regulates cell survival, neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. DHA can be obtained from the diet or synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) via a series of desaturation and elongation reactions occurring in the liver. Tracer studies suggest that dietary DHA can downregulate its own synthesis, but the mechanism remains undetermined and is the primary objective of this paper. First, we show by tracing 13C content (\u03b413C) of DHA via compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA), that following low dietary DHA, the brain receives DHA synthesized from ALA. We then show that dietary DHA increases mouse liver and serum EPA, which is dependant on ALA. Furthermore, by CSIA we demonstrate that the source of increased EPA is slowed EPA metabolism, not increased DHA retroconversion as previously assumed. DHA feeding alone or with ALA lowered liver elongation of very long-chain (ELOVL2, EPA elongation) enzyme activity despite no change in protein content. To further evaluate the role of ELOVL2, a liver-specific Elovl2 knockout was generated showing that DHA feeding in the presence or absence of a functional liver ELOVL2 yields similar results. An enzyme competition assay for EPA elongation suggests both uncompetitive and non-competitive inhibition by DHA depending on DHA levels. To translate our findings, we show that DHA supplementation in men and women increases EPA levels in a manner dependent on a SNP (rs953413) in the ELOVL2 gene. In conclusion, we identify a novel feedback inhibition pathway where dietary DHA downregulates its liver synthesis by inhibiting EPA elongation.",

In addition, p66Shc affects mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) formation were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mitochondrial function was evaluated by detected cytoplastic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).\n\n**Results**\n\nHigh glucose induces the expression and mitochondrial translocation of p66Shc, which promotes MAMs formation and stimulates PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy. Moreover, mitochondrial localized p66Shc reduces MMP and triggers cytosolic mtDNA release, thus activates cGAS/STING signaling and ultimately leads to enhanced autophagy and cellular senescence. Specially, we found p66Shc is required for the interaction between STING and LC3II, as well as between STING and ATG5, thereby regulates cGAS/STING-mediated autophagy. We also identified hundreds of genes associated several biological processes including aging are co-regulated by p66Shc and ATG5, deletion either of which results in diminished cellular senescence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\np66Shc is not only implicated in the initiation of autophagy by promoting MAMs formation, but also helps stabilizing active autophagic flux by activating cGAS/STING pathway in trophoblast.",
                "Abstract:\n\n**Background**: Daylength and the rates of changes in daylength have been associated with seasonal fluctuations in psychiatric symptoms and in cognition and mood in healthy adults. However, variations in human brain glucose metabolism in concordance with seasonal changes remain under explored.\n\n**Methods**: In this cross-sectional study, we examined seasonal effects on brain glucose metabolism, which we measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in 97 healthy participants. To maximize the sensitivity of regional effects, we computed relative metabolic measures by normalizing the regional measures to white matter metabolism. Additionally, we explored the role of rest-activity rhythms/sleep-wake activity measured with actigraphy in the seasonal variations of regional brain metabolic activity.\n\n**Results**: We found that seasonal variations of cerebral glucose metabolism differed across brain regions. Glucose metabolism in prefrontal regions increased with longer daylength and with greater day-to-day increases in daylength. The cuneus and olfactory bulb had the maximum and minimum metabolic values around the summer and winter solstice respectively (positively associated with daylength), whereas the temporal lobe, brainstem, and postcentral cortex showed maximum and minimum metabolic values around the spring and autumn equinoxes, respectively (positively associated with faster daylength gain). Longer daylength was associated with greater amplitude and robustness of diurnal activity rhythms suggesting circadian involvement.\n\n**Conclusions**: The current findings advance our knowledge of seasonal patterns in a key indicator of brain function relevant for mood and cognition. These data could inform treatment interventions for psychiatric symptoms that peak at specific times of the year.\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/seasonality-in-regional-brain-glucose-metabolism/873EB3A9561E316310E77062F436D206",
                "Abstract:\n>Background: A major risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders is old age. Nutritional interventions that delay aging, such as calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF), as well as pharmaceuticals that affect the pathways linking nutrition and aging processes, have been developed in recent decades and have been shown to alleviate the effects of aging on the brain. Summary: CR is accomplished by alternating periods of ad libitum feeding and fasting. In animal models, IF has been shown to increase lifespan and slow the progression and severity of age-related pathologies such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. According to recent research, dietary changes can help older people with dementia retain brain function. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of IF on the aging brain and related questions in this area of study (i.e., the potential of IF to treat neurodegenerative disorders) remain to be examined. Key Messages: This review addresses the hypothesis that IF may have translational potential in protecting the aged brain while summarizing the research supporting the putative neuroprotective mechanisms of IF in animal models. Additionally, given the emerging understanding of the connection between aging and dementia, our investigations may offer a fresh perspective on the use of dietary interventions for enhancing brain function and preventing dementia in elderly individuals. Finally, the absence of guidelines regarding the application of IF in patients hampers its broad utilization in clinical practice, and further studies are needed to improve our knowledge of the long-term effects of IF on dementia before it can be widely prescribed. In conclusion, IF may be an ancillary intervention for preserving memory and cognition in elderly individuals.",
                ">The therapeutic utilization of ketone bodies (KBs), induced through ketogenic diets (KDs)\u2014high-fat, very low-carbohydrate regimens\u2014has a history spanning over seven decades. This dietary approach has proven beneficial for individuals suffering from intractable epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, and cancer, owing to the significant enhancements in KB levels KDs facilitate. Ketone bodies, including acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetate, play a crucial role during states of starvation, low insulin signaling, and increased availability of fatty acids, thereby emerging as central to various therapeutic strategies. Despite their broad application, KDs association with increased health span and life span in mice (1, 2), anti-inflammatory effects on the gut (3), and the ongoing efforts to expand their use, especially in cardiology, recent studies have raised concerns about the potential off-target effects of KBs. Notably, preclinical animal model evidence points towards a diametrical impact of KBs on cardiac health (4\u20138), and their FA composition might also be crucial in a preclinical model of psoriasis (9). However, when carefully formulated, KDs have been evaluated as safe in children to manage epilepsy concerning cardiac parameters (10, 11). Similarly, another human KD study showed favorable outcomes for cardiovascular diseases (12), suggesting that the high ketogenic ratios and the limited variety in fat intake used in rodent preclinical models might not directly translate to human applications and a nuanced perspective is essential. This is in line with a meta-study indicating increased mortality when carbohydrates are replaced with animal-derived fats and proteins (13) underscoring the importance of careful consideration of the KD\u2019s fat composition and duration, balancing the potential benefits against possible long-term health risks. Within this Research Topic, we collected one review article and 4 original research articles to set a starting point for future Research Topics.\n\n>In the concise review by Andersen et al., the authors elucidate the significant impact of dietary interventions, such as fasting and KD, on health, emphasizing the pivotal role of KBs\u2014particularly beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)\u2014in the regulation of stem cell biology. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is characterized not solely as an energy substrate during periods of fasting or adherence to low-carbohydrate diets but also as a critical signaling molecule that influences key stem cell functions, including quiescence, differentiation, and subsequent tissue regeneration. The review details how the response to KBs varies among different stem cell types, with muscle satellite cells entering a state of pronounced quiescence that limits regeneration, while intestinal stem cells see a delay in differentiation that promotes tissue regeneration due to KB supplementation.\n\n>Buchholz et al. present a pioneering phase I/II randomized clinical trial on the feasibility and efficacy of the Modified Atkins Diet (a less stringent form of KD) in managing mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Their findings suggest that even trace amounts of ketones could enhance memory and vitality, marking a significant stride toward understanding dietary interventions in neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n>Dickens et al.\u2019s study on adults with super-refractory status epilepticus undergoing a KD reveals intriguing correlations between increased KB production, alterations in lipid and inflammatory profiles, and clinical outcomes. This study not only adds to the growing body of evidence supporting KD\u2019s benefits beyond epilepsy treatment but also opens new avenues for understanding the diet\u2019s impact on inflammation and lipid metabolism.\n\n>Xie et al. delve into the complexities of hyperinsulinemia\u2019s effects on the metabolic switch to KB utilization in proximal renal tubular epithelial cells, offering invaluable insights into potential therapeutic targets for renal protection under energy-deprived conditions. Their work highlights the delicate interplay between metabolic pathways in the face of hyperinsulinemia and starvation, pointing to the SIRT3/SMCT1 pathway as a critical regulator of KB absorption and utilization.\n\n>Finally, Diao et al.\u2019s comprehensive analysis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) underscores the pivotal role of KB metabolism in the disease\u2019s progression. By identifying novel molecular signatures, their research paves the way for targeted therapeutic strategies that could mitigate DKD\u2019s advancement, offering hope for those grappling with this condition.\n\n>As we conclude this editorial, it is clear that the contributions within this Research Topic not only illuminate the diverse roles of KB in health and disease but also underscore the burgeoning potential of KDs and KB supplementation in therapeutic settings. From regenerative medicine to neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, and beyond, the Research Topic navigates the complex landscape of KBs, offering fresh perspectives and beckoning further exploration into their therapeutic implications. This Research Topic serves as a beacon for future research, guiding us toward a more nuanced understanding of KBs and their place in medicine.",
                "Abstract:\n>Nitric oxide (NO), produced primarily by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes, is known to influence energy metabolism by stimulating fat uptake and oxidation. The effects of NO on de novo lipogenesis, however, are less clear. Here we demonstrate that hepatic expression of eNOS is reduced following prolonged administration of a hypercaloric high-fat diet. This results in marked reduction in the amount of S-nitrosylation of liver proteins including notably Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo lipogenesis. We further show that ACC S-nitrosylation markedly increases enzymatic activity. Diminished eNOS expression and ACC S-nitrosylation may thus represent a physiological adaptation to caloric excess by constraining lipogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that S-nitrosylation of liver proteins is subject to dietary control and suggest that de novo lipogenesis is coupled to dietary and metabolic conditions through ACC S-nitrosylation.",
                "Abstract:\n>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which cannot be synthesized by animals and must be supplied from the diet, have been strongly associated with human health. However, the mechanisms for their accretion remain poorly understood. Here, we show that LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), but not its homolog LRP6, selectively transports unesterified PUFAs into a number of cell types. The LDLa ligand-binding repeats of LRP5 directly bind to PUFAs and are required and sufficient for PUFA transport. In contrast to the known PUFA transporters Mfsd2a, CD36 and FATP2, LRP5 transports unesterified PUFAs via internalization to intracellular compartments including lysosomes, and n-3 PUFAs depend on this transport mechanism to inhibit mTORC1. This LRP5-mediated PUFA transport mechanism suppresses extracellular trap formation in neutrophils and protects mice from myocardial injury during ischemia-reperfusion. Thus, this study reveals a biologically important mechanism for unesterified PUFA transport to intracellular compartments.",
                "Abstract:\n>Given the comprehensive examination of the role of fatty acid-rich diets in central nervous system development in children, this study bridges significant gaps in the understanding of dietary effects on neurodevelopment. It delves into the essential functions of fatty acids in neurodevelopment, including their contributions to neuronal membrane formation, neuroinflammatory modulation, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Despite the acknowledged importance of these nutrients, this review reveals a lack of comprehensive synthesis in current research, particularly regarding the broader spectrum of fatty acids and their optimal levels throughout childhood. By consolidating the existing knowledge and highlighting critical research gaps, such as the effects of fatty acid metabolism on neurodevelopmental disorders and the need for age-specific dietary guidelines, this study sets a foundation for future studies. This underscores the potential of nutritional strategies to significantly influence neurodevelopmental trajectories, advocating an enriched academic and clinical understanding that can inform dietary recommendations and interventions aimed at optimizing neurological health from infancy.",
                "**Abstract**\n\nThe overconsumption of dietary fructose has been proposed as a major culprit for the rise of many metabolic diseases in recent years, yet the relationship between a high fructose diet and neurological dysfunction remains to be explored. Although fructose metabolism mainly takes place in the liver and intestine, recent studies have shown that a hyperglycemic condition could induce fructose metabolism in the brain. Notably, microglia, which are tissue-resident macrophages (M\u03c6s) that confer innate immunity in the brain, also express fructose transporters (GLUT5) and are capable of utilizing fructose as a carbon fuel. Together, these studies suggest the possibility that a high fructose diet can regulate the activation and inflammatory response of microglia by metabolic reprogramming, thereby altering the susceptibility of developing neurological dysfunction. In this review, the recent advances in the understanding of microglia metabolism and how it supports its functions will be summarized. The results from both in vivo and in vitro studies that have investigated the mechanistic link between fructose-induced metabolic reprogramming of microglia and its function will then be reviewed. Finally, areas of controversies and their associated implications, as well as directions that warrant future research will be highlighted.",
                "Abstract:\n>Oxidative stress can affect the protein, lipids, and DNA of the cells and thus, play a crucial role in several pathophysiological conditions. It has already been established that oxidative stress has a close association with inflammation via nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway. Amino acids are notably the building block of proteins and constitute the major class of nitrogen-containing natural products of medicinal importance. They exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, including the ability to activate NRF2, a transcription factor that regulates endogenous antioxidant responses. Moreover, amino acids may act as synergistic antioxidants as part of our dietary supplementations. This has aroused research interest in the NRF2-inducing activity of amino acids. Interestingly, amino acids' activation of NRF2-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) signaling pathway exerts therapeutic effects in several diseases. Therefore, the present review will discuss the relationship between different amino acids and activation of NRF2\u2013KEAP1 signaling pathway pinning their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. We also discussed amino acids formulations and their applications as therapeutics. This will broaden the prospect of the therapeutic applications of amino acids in a myriad of inflammation and oxidative stress-related diseases. This will provide an insight for designing and developing new chemical entities as NRF2 activators.",
                "Abstract:\n>Glucose has long been considered the primary fuel source for the brain. However, glucose levels fluctuate in the brain during sleep, intense circuit activity, or dietary restrictions, posing significant metabolic stress. Here, we demonstrate that the mammalian brain utilizes pyruvate as a fuel source, and pyruvate can support neuronal viability in the absence of glucose. Nerve terminals are sites of metabolic vulnerability within a neuron and we show that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is a critical step in oxidative ATP production in hippocampal terminals. We find that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is post-translationally modified by lysine acetylation which in turn modulates mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. Importantly, our data reveal that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier regulates distinct steps in synaptic transmission, namely, the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic vesicle release and the efficiency of vesicle retrieval, functions that have profound implications for synaptic plasticity. In summary, we identify pyruvate as a potent neuronal fuel and mitochondrial pyruvate uptake as a critical node for the metabolic control of synaptic transmission in hippocampal terminals.\n\n**Highlights**\n\nSerum pyruvate is taken up by the brain and efficiently oxidized in the TCA cycle.\n\nThe mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is essential for presynaptic energy metabolism.\n\nAcetylation of the MPC complex modulates mitochondrial pyruvate uptake.\n\nMPC activity regulates the release and retrieval of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals.",
                "\nAbstract:\n>In the present study, we examined the mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (mH2O2) generating capacity of \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) and compared it to components of the electron transport chain (ETC) using liver mitochondria isolated from male and female C57BL6N mice. We show for the first time there are some sex dimorphisms in the production of mH2O2 by ETC complexes I and III when mitochondria are fueled with different substrates. However, in our investigations into these sex effects, we made the unexpected discovery that: 1. KGDH serves as a major mH2O2 supplier in male and female liver mitochondria and 2. KGDH can form mH2O2 when mitochondria are energized with fatty acids, but only when malate is used to prime the Krebs cycle. Surprisingly, 2-keto-3-methylvaleric acid (KMV), a site-specific inhibitor for KGDH, nearly abolished mH2O2 generation in both male and female liver mitochondria oxidizing palmitoyl-carnitine. KMV inhibited mH2O2 production in liver mitochondria from male and female mice oxidizing myristoyl-, octanoyl-, or butyryl-carnitine. S1QEL 1.1 (S1) and S3QEL 2 (S3), compounds that inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by complexes I and III, respectively, without interfering with OxPhos, had a negligible effect on the rate of mH2O2 production when pyruvate or acyl-carnitines were used as fuels. However, inclusion of KMV in reaction mixtures containing S1 and/or S3 almost abolished mH2O2 generation. Together, our findings suggest KGDH is the main mH2O2 generator in liver mitochondria, even when fatty acids are used as fuel.",
                "\nAbstract:\n>Inefficient glucose metabolism and decreased ATP production in the brain are linked to ageing, cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). This study employed thermodynamic analysis to assess the effect of fish oil supplementation on glucose metabolism in ageing brains. Data from previous studies on glucose metabolism in the aged human brain and grey mouse lemur brains were examined. The results demonstrated that Omega-3 fish oil supplementation in grey mouse lemurs increased entropy generation and decreased Gibbs free energy across all brain regions. Specifically, there was a 47.4% increase in entropy generation and a 47.4 decrease in Gibbs free energy in the whole brain, indicating improved metabolic efficiency. In the human model, looking at the specific brain regions, supplementation with Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) reduced the entropy generation difference between elderly and young individuals in the cerebellum and particular parts of the brain cortex, namely the anterior cingulate and occipital lobe, with 100%, 14.29%, and 20% reductions, respectively. The Gibbs free energy difference was reduced only in the anterior cingulate by 60.64%. This research underscores that the application of thermodynamics is a comparable and powerful tool in comprehending the dynamics and metabolic intricacies within the brain.",
                "Abstract:\n>Skin has been shown to be a regulatory hub for energy expenditure and metabolism: mutations of skin lipid metabolism enzymes can change the rate of thermogenesis and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. However, little is known about the physiological basis for this function. Here we show that the thermal properties of skin are highly reactive to diet: within three days, a high fat diet reduces heat transfer through skin. In contrast, a dietary manipulation that prevents obesity accelerates energy loss through skins. We found that skin was the largest target in a mouse body for dietary fat delivery, and that fat was assimilated both by epidermis and by dermal white adipose tissue. Dietary triglyceride acyl groups persist in skin for weeks after feeding. Using multi-modal lipid profiling, we have implicated both keratinocytes and sebocytes in the altered lipids which correlate with thermal function. In response to high fat feeding, wax diesters and ceramides accumulate, and triglycerides become more saturated. In contrast, in response to the dramatic loss of adipose tissue that accompanies restriction of the branched chain amino acid isoleucine, skin becomes highly heat-permeable: skins shows limited uptake of dietary lipids and editing of wax esters, and acquires a signature of depleted signaling lipids, which include the acyl carnitines and lipid ethers. We propose that skin should be routinely included in physiological studies of lipid metabolism, given the size of the skin lipid reservoir and its adaptable functionality.",
                "Abstract:\n>Dietary glucose in excess is stored in the liver in the form of glycogen. As opposed to direct conversion of glucose into glycogen, the hypothesis of the postprandial lactate shuttle (PLS) proposes that dietary glucose uptake is metabolized to lactate in the gut, thereby being transferred to the liver for glycogen storage. In the present study, we provide evidence of a PLS in young healthy men and women. Overnight fasted participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, and arterialized lactate concentration and rate of appearance were determined. The concentration of lactate in the blood rose before the concentration of glucose, thus providing evidence of an enteric PLS. Secondary increments in the concentration of lactate in the blood and its rate of appearance coincided with those of glucose, which indicates the presence of a larger, secondary, systemic PLS phase driven by hepatic glucose release. The present study challenges the notion that lactate production is the result of hypoxia in skeletal muscles, because our work indicates that glycolysis proceeds to lactate in fully aerobic tissues and dietary carbohydrate is processed via lactate shuttling. Our study proposes that, in humans, lactate is a major vehicle for carbohydrate carbon distribution and metabolism.",

The effect of changes in caloric intake and macronutrient composition on their circulating levels in patients with type 2 diabetes are unknown.\n\n**Objective**\n\nTo explore the effects of a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein diet with and without a clinically significant weight loss on circulating levels of FGF21 and GDF15 in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe measured circulating FGF21 and GDF15 in patients with type 2 diabetes who completed 2 previously published diet interventions. Study 1 randomized 28 subjects to an isocaloric diet in a 6 + 6-week crossover trial consisting of, in random order, a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) or a conventional diabetes (CD) diet. Study 2 randomized 72 subjects to a 6-week hypocaloric diet aiming at a \u223c6% weight loss induced by either a CRHP or a CD diet. Fasting plasma FGF21 and GDF15 were measured before and after the interventions in a subset of samples (n = 24 in study 1, n = 66 in study 2).\n\n**Results**\n\nPlasma levels of FGF21 were reduced by 54% in the isocaloric study (P < .05) and 18% in the hypocaloric study (P < .05) in CRHP-treated individuals only. Circulating GDF15 levels increased by 18% (P < .05) following weight loss in combination with a CRHP diet but only in those treated with metformin.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe CRHP diet significantly reduced FGF21 in people with type 2 diabetes independent of weight loss, supporting the role of FGF21 as a \u201cnutrient sensor.\u201d Combining metformin treatment with carbohydrate restriction and weight loss may provide additional metabolic improvements due to the rise in circulating GDF15.",

Our recent findings revealed that ectopic expression of the pluripotency transcription factor NANOG rejuvenates dysfunctional mitochondria of senescent cells by rewiring metabolic pathways. In this study, we report that NANOG restores the expression of key enzymes, PYCR1 and PYCR2, in the proline biosynthesis pathway. Additionally, senescent mesenchymal stem cells manifest severe mitochondrial respiratory impairment, which is alleviated through proline supplementation. Proline induces mitophagy by activating AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1 and upregulating Parkin expression, enhancing mitochondrial clearance and ultimately restoring cell metabolism. Notably, proline treatment also mitigates several aging hallmarks, including DNA damage, senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase, inflammatory cytokine expressions, and impaired myogenic differentiation capacity. Overall, this study highlights the role of proline in mitophagy and its potential in reversing senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and aging hallmarks."

                "My overall interpretation of the study linked above, which is among numerous follow-up papers, indicates that there is a measurable reduction in body metabolism for some individuals, accompanied by significant variance in the extent of metabolic adaptation. This suggests that the issue is complex, and not everyone who loses weight experiences this metabolic change. The study's design does not allow for causal analysis and lacks a comparison group, so we can only infer associations.\n\nIt appears that for some, the metabolic reduction is significant, while for others it's minor, aligning with what I've observed in related studies. Even a 100 kcal/day imbalance can accumulate over time. As in many areas within the nutrition field, these studies reveal extensive individual variability and lack of control over many variables.\n\nI am aware that the study involved an extreme diet and exercise program, and these results may not reflect the outcomes of more moderate lifestyle changes. However, it introduces a note of caution about potential metabolic reductions. I mentioned this study to counter the claims that one doesn't need to worry about a slowing metabolism. The only firm conclusion I can draw is that some people may indeed be affected.\n\nFrom my perspective, a reduced metabolism isn't inherently problematic. An efficient metabolism could even be beneficial, although this particular benefit is not derived from the study but from other literature. It's important to remember that if metabolism does slow, one must adapt their diet and exercise regime to the new metabolic rate, rather than relying on their former metabolic state.",

If there is excess protein, and that is antiketogenic, and hence reduced ketones, then the demand for glucose goes up -- so that seems like demand.\n\nAs I see it the body can convert excess aminos to glucose or the kidney can filter them out. While the former is inefficient,  it is still way more efficient than pissing the aminos away.   That seems like it would be the case for  either either low/no carb  or carb-heavy, but maybe greater demand in low-carb since there would be less glucose to begin with.

Thus there was insufficient extra energy in the diet to exceed the needs to refill the muscle/liver glycogen stores, so its not surprising all the extra glucose was taken up by the muscles/liver.      EGP in such a short term, health subject study offers little insight. \n\nEGP importance depends why one does keto. If doing it for mental benefits, then its the level of ketones that matter -- these are the majority of the people I'm trying to help.    When the liver is busy with GNG, then its not making as much (or making any) ketones.  But also in the longer term,  even for those doing this for other health benefits (e.g. reversing metabolic syndrome) the GNG is increasing insulin regularly which is not good for recovery from MS.

But that is very strict and more difficult to maintain.\n\nFrom my reading (and the posts here).

                "The findings presented in this review suggest that high fructose consumption may pose significant challenges to brain health by inducing metabolic reprogramming and pro-inflammatory activation of microglia. The ability of fructose to be endogenously produced in the brain under hyperglycemic conditions, combined with its potential to promote a shift towards glycolytic metabolism and inflammatory signaling in microglia, raises concerns about its long-term effects on neuroinflammation and cognitive function. The observed upregulation of fructose metabolism genes, ROS generation, and inflammatory markers in the hippocampus of high fructose diet models highlights the need for further research to elucidate the mechanisms and consequences of fructose-induced microglial dysfunction. Addressing these challenges will require a multifaceted approach that considers the complex interplay between diet, metabolism, and immune function in the brain.\n\nPotential interventions to mitigate the effects of high fructose consumption on microglial inflammation and brain health:\n\n1. Dietary interventions:\n   a. Reducing fructose intake\n   b. Increasing consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA)\n   c. Ketogenic diets or exogenous ketone supplementation (e.g., \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate)\n   d. Increasing intake of plant-derived polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol, curcumin, flavonoids)\n   e. Increasing dietary fiber intake to promote SCFA production by gut microbiota\n\n2. Lifestyle interventions:\n   a. Regular physical exercise\n   b. Intermittent fasting\n   c. Sleep hygiene and maintaining a healthy circadian rhythm\n\n3. Pharmacological interventions:\n   a. Anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., minocycline)\n   b. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists\n   c. Melatonin supplementation: Studies have shown that melatonin doses ranging from 5-50 mg per day can exert anti-inflammatory effects, with the most commonly studied doses falling within the range of 10-30 mg per day. These doses are higher than those typically used for melatonin's sleep-promoting properties and may be effective in managing fructose-induced neuroinflammation.\n\n4. Targeting anti-inflammatory pathways:\n   a. Enhancing the effects of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-10, IL-13)\n   b. Modulating NF-\u03baB and Nrf2 signaling pathways:\n      - NF-\u03baB inhibition: Application of specific NF-\u03baB inhibitors, such as the peptide SN50 or the small molecule BAY 11-7082, to reduce pro-inflammatory gene expression and microglial activation.\n      - Nrf2 activation: Use of Nrf2 activators, like sulforaphane, dimethyl fumarate, or bardoxolone methyl, to enhance the expression of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes, thereby protecting against fructose-induced oxidative stress and inflammation.\n   c. Inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation:\n      - Small molecule inhibitors: Application of specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, such as MCC950 or the ketone body \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, to block the assembly and activation of the inflammasome complex and reduce IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 production.\n      - Naturally derived compounds: Use of plant-derived compounds, like curcumin, resveratrol, or epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation through various mechanisms.\n\n5. Gut microbiota modulation:\n   a. Probiotics and prebiotics to promote beneficial gut bacteria and SCFA production:\n      - Probiotics: Supplementation with specific probiotic strains, such as Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, or Akkermansia muciniphila, which have been shown to reduce inflammation, improve gut barrier function, and modulate microglial activation.\n      - Prebiotics: Consumption of prebiotic fibers, like inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), or galactooligosaccharides (GOS), to selectively stimulate the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria, leading to increased production of SCFAs (butyrate, propionate, and acetate) that exert anti-inflammatory effects on microglia.\n      - Synbiotics: Combination of probiotics and prebiotics to synergistically promote a healthy gut microbiome and enhance the production of anti-inflammatory metabolites.\n   b. Fecal microbiota transplantation to restore a healthy gut microbiome\n\n6. Combination therapies:\n   a. Combining dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacological interventions for synergistic effects\n   b. Personalized approaches based on individual metabolic and inflammatory profiles\n\nBy investigating these potential interventions and their underlying mechanisms, researchers can develop targeted strategies to counteract the detrimental effects of high fructose consumption on microglial function and brain health. A comprehensive approach that addresses the multifaceted nature of fructose-induced neuroinflammation will be essential for developing effective preventive and therapeutic measures. Targeting specific anti-inflammatory pathways, such as modulating NF-\u03baB and Nrf2 signaling and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as well as modulating the gut microbiota through the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, may provide more focused interventions to counteract the effects of high fructose consumption on microglial inflammation and brain health.

This oversight led to guidelines that inaccurately lumped these fats together, failing to address the unique risks posed by trans fats.\n- **Impact on Public Health**: By promoting a high intake of polyunsaturated fats (specifically linoleic acid) and ignoring the diverse roles and sources of saturated fats, dietary guidelines may have inadvertently contributed to other health issues, such as inflammatory diseases and imbalances in omega fatty acid ratios.\n\n#### **Reevaluation of Dietary Cholesterol**\n- **Weak Correlation with Serum Cholesterol**: Emerging evidence, discussed in the paper, shows that dietary cholesterol has a less significant effect on blood cholesterol levels than previously thought, leading to changes in guidelines that no longer set strict limits on cholesterol intake.\n- **Individual Differences**: The paper emphasizes that the impact of dietary cholesterol varies widely among individuals, challenging the one-size-fits-all approach to dietary recommendations.\n\n#### **Contemporary Understanding and Recommendations**\n- **Need for Differentiation**: The paper calls for a reevaluation of the health impacts of different types of fats, advocating for a distinction between harmful trans fats and potentially less harmful saturated fats.\n- **Importance of Balance**: It highlights the need for dietary guidelines to emphasize a balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids to prevent inflammation and other metabolic issues.\n- **Holistic Dietary Patterns**: Rather than isolating single nutrients (like fats or cholesterol), the paper supports guidelines that consider overall dietary patterns and their broader health impacts, encouraging diverse and balanced food intake.\n\n#### **Implications for Future Research and Policy**\n- **Research Directions**: The paper suggests that future research should continue to explore the nuanced effects of various fats on health, including long-term studies that differentiate between fat types and their sources.\n- **Policy Adjustments**: There is a call for policy makers to update and adjust dietary guidelines based on current scientific evidence, moving away from outdated assumptions about dietary fats and heart disease.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe paper provides a thorough critique of historical and current dietary guidelines influenced by the lipid-heart hypothesis. It advocates for a shift towards more evidence-based, nuanced, and individualized dietary recommendations that recognize the complex roles of different fats in health and disease.\n\nThis expanded analysis reflects the depth of the paper's arguments and the significant implications for dietary research and public health policy."

For background, I used to be pretty heavily keto, but going to medical school helped me learn not just how to read evidence based medicine, but how to find good quality trials, data, and papers to help come to a medical judgement.\n\nFor those claiming that normal levels of cholesterol are associated with a higher risk of heart attacks / heart disease / death / whatever, I\u2019d highly recommend checking out [this](https://youtu.be/a3lHHnOHyr8?si=7w-d4_D-p3kE-WXj) video that busts this myth. The U curve association is commonly seen in epidemiological studies and tends to confound real patterns. This allows people to incorrectly view LDL and disease association, making it seem like a \u201cgotcha,\u201d or a win for keto.\n\nThe hard truth is that high LDL has consistently been associated with poorer outcomes in relation to cardiovascular disease and mortality. There have been no long term data studying the vascular safety of ketogenic diets. Until real data emerges with proper clinical trials in reputed journals, we need to dispel the myth of keto being the solution to all of humanities ailments, as many here and on r/keto regularly do. We simply don\u2019t know enough to make such a claim. To suggest otherwise is absurd.\n\nCurrent data from the strongest trials conducted over several decades with peer review suggest a lower LDL improves CV morbidity / mortality, and that a mediterranean diet is most healthful.\n\nWhat really saddens me is that people have been studying nutrition science and metabolism their whole lives, have multiple degrees in this, have been awarded several grants and done the highest levels of research work on this stuff in humanity\u2019s history, and their work gets overshadowed by armchair experts or tik tok influencers who believe the work of every major scientist and health organization is flawed. What makes you think you know better?\n\nIf you think some Big Industry paid off Big Science or Big Pharma or Big Whatever, it literally doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t care who\u2019s making money as long as my patients are healthy.\n\nAnd if you want to prove keto\u2019s efficacy, go run a trial. If new evidence emerges proving keto\u2019s superiority, I\u2019ll happily reconsider my position in light of new evidence.\n\nAll this is not to say that keto is 100% bad. Most diets have some helpful qualities. Keto is great for people trying to lose weight quickly over a short term period, for example. And it is great for epileptics. I\u2019m on this subreddit still because I find some of the science and metabolism intriguing, but I would never recommend it to a patient because it doesn\u2019t have enough data to support its safety.\n\nFollow high quality evidence and data in your health decisions. I always recommend reviewing the most up-to-date dietary [guidelines](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf) and speaking to professionals (read: not \u201cexperts\u201d, but professionals). It\u2019s always great to have theories and ideas, but we don\u2019t act based on whims and ideas. We act based on data.\n\nMy recommendation regarding your health question is to make an appointment with a physician who researches lipid science at a center of excellence, and they can guide you through the most recent data and evidence and help you make a decision as to what is best for your health.",

Also it wouldn\u2019t hurt them to get a second opinion locally as well, if they are looking for one.\n\nI\u2019ve actually felt the opposite. It seems clinical guidelines are changing almost daily (for things like infection management and primary prevention strategies for things like cancer), but the training (like the stuff we learn in medical school) feels very static. Exams often test outdated practices, and they update rather slowly over the years. All our attendings tell us to just memorize it the way the boards want us to for now, but to realize that management will change once we enter clerkships.\n\nAs far as industry influences go, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re everywhere.

Patients who inquire about data in regards to their health situation should *always* be referred to a physician. Unless a patient is looking for alternative medicine because they\u2019ve stopped trusting in evidence-based medicine, there is no point where all resources would be exhausted.\n\nIf someone comes to this subreddit to learn more about ketogenic diets *in theory*, then that makes sense. If someone is using this data to apply *in practice*, then we have a problem. Because like I said, current data on keto does not have that level of power to inform health decisions.\n\nHad the post simply asked, \u201cWhat is the consensus on LDL,\u201d then that is sensible to allow. When a patient clearly is using input from here (where many of the commenters have no formal education in this field and have no business giving out health advice), then I don\u2019t see reason to allow it. Again, I think you\u2019ll find very few (if any) niche situations where it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to refer to a physician.\n\nAnd for a subreddit that values science, I\u2019d wish many of the commenters could provide a reasoned explanation with facts and data to support their claims. Keto science is great for exploring the emerging data on keto. But people have been taking it too far by denouncing seed oils and endorsing high LDL. *The totality of the evidence is just not there yet to support many of these claims.* Again, if it changes, I\u2019m open to change my mind.

The mediterranean diet has several decades of research with some of the largest trials in the world. And if you\u2019re asking me for citations, then I\u2019ll ask you to do the same. What is your source for your claim that keto is the most studied diet?\n\nThe mediterranean diet does not advocate for a low fat diet. In fact, the evidence is weak that a high fat diet increases the risk of heart disease. What does increase risk of heart disease are saturated fats and trans fats ([source - meta analysis of 60 controlled trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12716665/)). The mediterranean diet recommends high fruit and vegetable consumption, fatty fish and olive oil consumption, and whole grains for fiber intake. You could technically do mediterranean diet in ketosis if you wanted to, just by increasing the amounts of fish and olive oil and reducing the amount of whole grains.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201ctheir guidelines force them to.\u201d The guidelines are designed around the research, not the other way around. Claiming otherwise is conspiratorial and requires substantial evidence to support it\u2014not just what your hear on tik tok. If you actually read the guidelines and view all the citations, they link to super high quality published data, from some of the largest trials around the world. And if you\u2019ve actually been involved in research, you\u2019d know that institutions keep databases of trial data that report to societal databases, which publish the guidelines. They\u2019re highly evidence based. And suggesting otherwise invalidates the work of decades of the most prolific researchers who have been pioneers in our understanding of longevity and heart disease.\n\nLook, I have no problems with you or whoever doing keto. But let\u2019s not sit here and promote it to the general public as if we know what we\u2019re talking about, because we both know there isn\u2019t enough data to support that. The simple truth is that keto doesn\u2019t have enough RCTs over many years to prove it. If one day that changes, then fine. But until then, it\u2019s irresponsible to make unsubstantiated claims.\n\nEDIT: And to your claim that there are 300 active RCTs, did you check how many there are for mediterranean? And even if there are 300 underway\u2014that doesn\u2019t mean that all 300 are published. Why not wait till the published data is out before claiming keto\u2019s superiority? Try to espouse an evidence-based mindset.",
                "So unlike you, I actually took the time to go through everything you linked to.\n\nOn \u201cclinicaltrials.gov,\u201d if you search for ketogenic diet under interventions, you get 397 results. If you search for mediterranean diet, you get 478 results. You forgot to mention that, didn\u2019t you? Funny how that happens. I will again make the point that regardless of how many trials are ongoing, it doesn\u2019t matter because none of these are published. We make guidelines based on published research, not preliminary data.\n\nJust by pure numbers alone, you linked to roughly 30 clinical trials claiming keto superiority. Even if they were not cherry picked, ~30 is nowhere near close to the hundreds of trials done on mediterranean.\n\nMost of your linked trials are low carb, not ketogenic. And I personally have no problem with low carb. Additionally, certain studies like the one published in Atherosclerosis 2016 were actually done with low saturated fat.\n\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out elsewhere on this thread, keto is great for short term weight loss, so it\u2019s not surprising that these RCTs show short term weight loss. Guess what else demonstrably improves every metric of metabolic syndrome? Weight loss. So on paper, ketogenic diet seems great.\n\nAnd yet, not a single RCT you linked shows long term data (correct me if I\u2019m wrong). Several of your trials quit the RCT approach after 1-2 years and went on to report observational data, finding that even though keto group had better numbers in the short term, they had greater mortality in the long term. I take this with a grain of salt, of course, because it is not controlled, but it is still interesting to see.\n\n[Here](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/38/32/2459/3745109?login=false) is a link to a report that has 20 million person-years of follow up, claiming convincingly that LDL is associated with heart disease. Can you find me anything similar to vouch for keto? Until you can, I will continue to promote mediterranean.\n\nYou will perhaps claim that it is impossible to do a trial for that long. Perhaps you\u2019re right. Can you at least find substantial observational data going back several decades that shows less mortality on a high fat diet? I couldn\u2019t find anything.\n\nJust because you can lose weight faster with an intervention does not make it superior for overall health. There is importance to doing things safely. Let me emphasize this: *There is no long-term evidence to support the safety of ketogenic diets.*\n\nI\u2019m not trying to do a \u201cgotcha\u201d or anything. I\u2019m legitimately serious\u2014if you have substantial data supporting long-term safety of keto or high saturated fat diet, then send it my way.\n\nYour observations about exploding obesity and diabetes etc are correct. It may even be plausible that it is a result of a high carb diet. But I\u2019m not sure how you get from there to \u201cbest way to prevent metabolic syndrome is to have sky high LDL.\u201d Is clean eating, sleep, and exercise not enough?\n\nThere are so many things that can cause the obesity pandemic, and y\u2019all chose to focus on carbs. I get it\u2014sugar is awful. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the answer is to consume copious amounts of saturated fat to meet your daily caloric needs. Like there has to be a balance somewhere. You can cut out the sugar and eat clean and still reap the long term benefits.\n\nMy final point is that I\u2019m happy to debate the science. But at the end of the day, you should not be promoting health advice to patients that isn\u2019t based on the strongest data for health. I don\u2019t normally comment on this sub (I\u2019m just here to read papers), but I\u2019m taking the time to do so right now because y\u2019all are choosing to misguide a patient. It\u2019s irresponsible.\n\nEDIT: and btw, examining the short- and long-term evidence is part of what is known as *examining the totality of the evidence.* This is what is done when creating guidelines for diet and health.",
                "nearly all the studies you sent me from the diet doctor list weight loss as the primary (and most distinct) change in trial participant data\u2014which i agree with. not sure why you think it\u2019s some obscure fascination of mine\u2014just read the trial data lol.\n\n\u201cbullshit food frequency questionnaire\u201d literally proves you didn\u2019t read what I sent. either that, or you\u2019ve gone so far off the deep end that you believe every organization in the world is secretly collaborating to destroy our health, so it\u2019s not worth reading any studies that disagree with that view.\n\nit\u2019s impossible to have a discussion with you when you aren\u2019t even reading my data. im taking time to read what you\u2019re sending, and you won\u2019t even read what im suggesting.\n\nThe purpose of the PNAS article you sent was to confirm that neanderthals were carnivore\u2014it provides zero epidemiological data. by citing the PNAS article, you\u2019re making a common logical fallacy in suggesting that our historic diet means that this is exactly what we should be eating. This actually doesn\u2019t make much sense\u2014we\u2019ve also evolved to store fat in our abdomens; does that mean we should keep storing fat there? Of course not\u2014fat accumulates around the pancreas and causes pancreatic dysfunction, contributing to DMII, among other things.\n\nWe have evolved imperfectly\u2014we\u2019re not as well-oiled as you think we are (but you would need to go to medical school to understand this). Our diets at the time were based on what we could hunt and scavenge. That doesn\u2019t mean they were perfect for us. No single species is perfectly adapted to its environment. Humans, as advanced as we are, are still trying to adapt to our environment (antibiotic resistance, for example).\n\nAnd to whichever article you\u2019re citing about industry involvement\u2014people are going to try to find ways to take monetary advantage of every situation that arises. If the world were to suddenly shift keto, do you not think people would milk that? Hell, we\u2019ve already got carnivore influencers selling their own supplements \u2014 there is no freedom from industry influence. \n\nIn any case, *I\u2019m still waiting for an article from you showing reduced morbidity / mortality on a long-term ketogenic / high saturated fat diet.* Keep it coming, buddy\u2014you\u2019re getting nowhere with this. You\u2019re dancing around the absence of the real data, instead citing evolutionary diets and industry influence. I agree that we evolved as heavy meat eaters. I agree that there is heavy industry influence. I agree that keto has a lot of short term benefits. But before I recommend to patients, I need data ensuring long term safety.\n\nEdit: didn\u2019t see the last article you sent until after my comment. but that also doesnt help your argument. so what if no cap was established? the point is to limit saturated fat intake. we might not have the data to know where to set a hard limit, but what we do know is that higher saturated fat intake is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Some people get lung cancer after smoking for only 10 years. Others smoke their whole life and don\u2019t get lung cancer. Does that mean, since we don\u2019t know where the hard cutoff is for smoking, that we shouldn\u2019t tell people to limit cigarettes? That\u2019s the kind of logic you\u2019re bringing into this",
                "Why shouldn\u2019t we store fat in our feet? (and btw, we do\u2014just a little) Of course we need fat during famine\u2014the problem is we\u2019ve stored it in the wrong area, and that causes disease. Again, we\u2019ve evolved imperfectly.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to run an unethical study to prove keto\u2019s superiority. I\u2019m sure there have been people following keto / carnivore for decades. Just test them. But I bet you can\u2019t\u2014most of them have probably had a cardiovascular event by now.\n\nEDIT: and guess what? the reason we have morbidity / mortality data on mediterranean is because people have died following it, so we can log their data and compare it against others. That\u2019s the whole point. So until enough of y\u2019all die off, we can\u2019t make logical assumptions as to whether your diet actually improves risk of mortality. THAT is why we don\u2019t recommend it to patients.",
                "This shows your poor understanding of physiology, both adult and pediatric. But again, you\u2019d need to go to medical school to learn about how hormones affect the location of fat storage, and how location has little to no impact on overall lipid circulation. If you\u2019ve looked inside a cadaver, you\u2019d understand how fat storage works. And if you understood metabolism and biochemistry, you\u2019d understand that lipids are not used for fast energy\u2014therefore, they don\u2019t *necessarily* need to be stored nearby. (I\u2019m curious now\u2014Is this how you talk out of your ass when you\u2019re trying to convince someone about your diet? Wow, you are dangerous! like a walking r/confidentlyincorrect)\n\nBut since you continue to claim that humans evolved perfectly, I\u2019ll provide another example for you and any other future readers: sleep position. If you run a google image search on mammals sleeping (try it), you will notice nearly every image shows mammals sleeping on their stomach. Contrary to what most people believe, humans would actually benefit greatly if we could sleep on our stomachs. The pericardial sac presses against the pleura, preventing the full extent of lung expansion. Flipping around would allow the lungs to expand without resistance. Unfortunately, our head and neck anatomy developed in such a way after we became bipedal such that we lost the ability to sleep prone comfortably (most humans will now sleep on their side\u2014going against our evolutionary anatomy). Still, lying prone is recommended during respiratory infection to allow for maximal aeration. So I will again repeat: we are evolutionarily imperfect. I can give dozens of more examples of this\u2014we see a lot of it in medicine.\n\nThis is all besides the point. The rapidity of your responses to my comments with linked material (as well as your inaccurate summaries of them, and your immediate dismissal of them) indicates to me that not only are you not reading anything I am sending, but that you simply don\u2019t value a discussion where you can hear opposing views and engage in critical thinking. That is not how science works.\n\nAt this point, you\u2019re arguing for the sake of argument. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019ve attached your whole identity to this diet, and anyone who goes against it is attacking your identity (that actually seems to happen a lot on this sub). There is no ownership or identity required in scientific thought. All science requires is an open mind. Like I said, I\u2019ve tried keto\u2014I\u2019ve read all the same papers as you have. I\u2019ve kept an open mind. Even in this discussion, I\u2019ve read everything you linked (sometimes more carefully than even you have!). And after examining the totality of the evidence, I\u2019ve chosen a side. And I\u2019m willing to change sides again if the data supports it in the future.\n\nThankfully, my point here was made a couple comments back **when you admitted that there is no data on the long term safety of ketogenic / carnivore / high-fat diets, as you write \u201cthis study does not and will not exist.\u201d** I doubt it will not exist, but right now, it certainly does not exist, as you correctly pointed out!\n\n**Thus, since we have no long term data on it, we do not recommend it to patients. Case closed.**\n\nIf you\u2019re actually willing to have a real scientific debate, then you will send a well-reasoned and articulate reply with facts and pertinent citations. But if you send me a dismissive reply with no factual basis (as I expect you will, but I\u2019d be happy to be proven wrong), I won\u2019t respond from here on out.

That all said, this sub really shouldn\u2019t influence your health decisions, and I would urge you to visit a physician\u2014your health is too important to be swayed by potentially misinformed voices on the internet (including my own).

I\u2019d say the same thing to ignore medication. Statins pretty much lowers your cholesterol because it shuts down your liver from producing its own cholesterol. Wtf right? What you need to do is stay hydrated 24/7. Exercise as much as you can, doesn\u2019t matter what type of exercise it is. Eat a clean Whole Foods plant based diet. You should see that your cholesterol levels will improve tremendously if you stick to it. No medication needed. What got you there in the first place is what you\u2019ve been putting in your mouth! I provided a picture of my results to show you that it can be done with strenuous exercise and eating clean. I know an LDL of 75 is difficult to achieve but you just need to start taking those first baby steps. Eventually you\u2019ll get there! Any questions, just ask me :)"

You must know that would be so extraordinarily difficult for most Americans that it is essentially little more than an aspiration, even less helpful than 'lose weight and exercise.'  When I was a postdoc at a medical school that would have been the clear route, but today I find it difficult to get an appointment with a P.A..\n\n Other than that, I would mention that the farther one gets from one's early training, the more apparent the heavy inertia of scientific, and especially medical, knowledge becomes.  There are good reasons for that of course with medicine, as we don't really know jack until the completion of clinical trials.  And there the pernicious influence of funding does come in -- as you know trials can be incredibly expensive and thus are more likely to examine the next potential block buster pharmaceutical.  There isn't that much funding for the kinds of trials that essentially have no ROI.  And so the online peddlers, trained or not, fill the vacuum.",

Unfortunately the public perception of that, and a rash of fraudulent research coming to light, seems to have brought us to a nadir of public opinion -- something that the medical establishment could ill afford.  It would be like herding cats to try to convince scientists to have a consistent message, and things can get ugly in fields like climate when there is more awareness of the larger political implications of work.    \nWell rambling now.

                "Well it's highly contextual and dependant on a number of variables. Quite frankly the answer is, it depends. \n\nCarbs are protein sparing... in so much as the if the bodies requirements for glucose are met by carbs, the body won't need to convert protein into glucose. \n\nHowever, if you are metabolically healthy and have a low or zero carb diet \"too much\" protein is unlikely to \"kick you out\" of ketosis as your body is not going to convert the excess protein into glucose to the extent glucose isn't required to meet demand. Converting protein to glucose is metabolically costly for the body, so it would ideally prefer to take the path of least resistance. \n\nWhat excess protein will do however is lower your ketone levels. This is partly because the \"too much\" protein is converted into a circulating amino acid pool which is available as required for both metabolic uses and glucose production. This will in turn decrease (but not eliminate) the requirements for ketones. \n\nI don't measure my ketones, but if I did right now they would be fairly low, maybe 0.5 mmol/l. If I wanted to get my ketones higher, I would either need to fast for a few days or increase fat and drop protein & carbs way down for quite a while, maybe a week (not sure haven't tried). \n\nThe reason being, I feel better eating 30 - 40% of my calories as protein. So to run down my amino acid pool takes some time, since my body is still processing my last meal, then using the amino acid pool as a savings bank. From my experience with extended fasting, it takes about 48 - 72 hours before my ketones start drifting sharply upwards. They might be: 0 hours 0.5mmol, 24 hours 0.7mmol, 48 hours 1 mmol, 72 hours 1.4 mmol.",

If there is excess protein, and that is antiketogenic, and hence reduced ketones, then the demand for glucose goes up -- so that seems like demand.\n\nDemand is demand - I've been in ketosis for 5 - 6 years and I'm pretty much always in ketosis even though my carb intake varies wildly. I speculate that certain metabolic machinery just runs on ketones as a default after a while. \n\nThe red blood cells, some cells in the kidneys, brain & testes will always require glucose. I've seen figures of a minimum required per day of 130g, although I suspect for me it is higher as I'm 194cm. \n\nIf I don't eat any protein for a few days, my body will respond by upregulating ketones and fatty acids for fuel, and switch to producing glucose from fat. HGH will rise, preserving bodily protein stores. So my blood ketones will go up. \n\nIf I start eating protein again, my body will switch from using fat as fuel to using more protein - both as required to the extent it is available, and as demanded. How much protein I need from day to day will vary depending on multiple metabolic factors. How much is left over, the use my body makes of it will be whatever way is most efficient.",

Because, as I have said ad nauseum, it is metabolically costly to do so from protein.\n\nPerhaps in some people who are constantly zero carb, you may see a small repletion in liver glycogen before seeing a compensatory down regulation in gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. Which leads to a breakdown in that glycogen. And on we go.\n\n>Or do you think that only exogenous carbs can be stored as glycogen?\n\nWell yeah, as liver glycogen. That's basic biology.",
                "You've written lots of I think, I suppose, why can't suppositions, but you don't need to be a biochemist to understand basic physiology. \n\nYou could have done a basic search for \"how does glycogen affect gluconeogenesis\" and you would straight away see articles describing how the liver first depletes glycogen before initiating the production of glucose de novo. \n\nWhat information do we now have? :-\n\n1. The de novo cost of gluconeogenesis is 33% of the energy content of the produced glucose\n2. Minimum required glucose per day is 130g for the red blood cells etc\n3. The body also requires 0.8g/kg of protein for basic physiology\n4. The liver won't initiate gluconeogenesis in the presence of liver glycogen\n\nSo we are going to need a lot of protein for there to be an \"excess\" and if there is one, gluconeogenesis will be downregulated if glycogen stores start forming. Glycogen levels would be nothing like the kind of glycogen you'd get from eating carbs, simply because the liver would shut off gluconeogenesis once glycogen got to a certain point. \n\nI think if I was a much smaller guy and ate as much protein as I do, my ketones would be very minimal. Given I'm a big guy and my body seems hungry for protein, I can remain in a moderate level of ketosis despite eating a lot of protein. These things are always context dependant.",
                ">Diabetics are always in gluconeogenesis mode, yet their liver glycogen are full.\n\nYou're using an example for people who have broken metabolism, to say this is how metabolism \"\"should\" work or how you would like it to work?\n\nLook, to make glucose, the body needs glucagon to stimulate liver production, right? And the insulin to glucagon ratio would need to favour glucagon for gluconeogenesis.  But glucagon is a hormone that triggers liver glycogen to convert back into glucose and to enter your bloodstream so that your body can use it for energy. \n\nDo you see the problem, at all here?",
                "Of course I've read it, I just tend to disagree with it on basic first principles. Supply is important but in this instance demand is more so. This is why people like me who eat a LOT of protein have lower levels of ketones (0.5mmol/l, keto for 6ish years) although my diet is still ketogenic. \n\nBasically your position boils down to you feel like this could be true and you like it. Whereas mine is, the liver sets the condition and the metabolic machinery operates accordingly. You haven't demonstrated at all that the liver will store glycogen from gluconeogenesis, you've just asserted you would like it if that happened. You haven't acknowledged the simple fact that liver glycogen status is the driving factor which determines whether or not ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis even takes place in the first instance. Nor the simple fact that glucagon acts to break down glycogen, and that glucagon is required for gluconeogenesis. \n\nThe only thing of any substance you have said is that type 2 diabetics have run away blood sugar from gluconeogenesis, while ignoring that they also have rampant and uncontrolled insulin, the literal hallmark of their condition. \n\n>Learn to think out of the box, or at least learn to study your opponents arguements, before making counter-arguements \n\nJesus wept, your hubris is out of control.",

But nonetheless, this is exactly what you would expect to see - more insulin required to shuttle amino acids to their end destination, more glucagon to offset the insulin rise and keep blood sugar stable. \n\nMy superman reference was simply that your argument isn't with me. I've just been explaining the basic functions of the body. If that makes me a biochemist, then I guess ignorance abounds.",

I\u2019ve had some nausea on and off and I\u2019m probably eating less but nothing drastic by any means. I\u2019m happy to hear it\u2019s similar for others too so there\u2019s still hope.

Thank you! I'm definitely going to continue to do social media sleuthing as I continue to date because I found no record of anything I found out on social media when I did an online search and background check.

I've felt pretty depressed this past week but glad I finally said something and now I can move on in peace. \n\nI actually found yesterday (through social media research), that he was abusive to his ex-wife and has drinking issues which really sickened me. Sad part is I did look him up before dating and none of this came up which makes dating scary. He basically gave me the revisionist history versions of all the stories in his past that alot of guys do to seem like the hero/victim in their past relationships. I always hate to hear about things like this after the relationship ends but I take it as a blessing that I avoided those things happening to me. Glad I can just focus on myself, as trying to forge a new lifestyle is already hard enough without adding drama to it. Thanks again. I know it will get better in time.",

I'm still not feeling really hungry and I'm kind of struggling to meet my recommended calorie limit. I guess a good perk is now I don't have to really worry about figuring out calories during dates lol. So now I've subtracted two problems haha. \n\nI had my fifth injection this afternoon and that no hunger feeling is only amplified now. Feeling this weird heartburn-ish sensation near my throat. Interested to see how the rest of the week will go.

I'm definitely allowing myself to go through all the emotions I'm feeling. \n\nI'm already love my self care days and they are helping me feel good and I appreciate having more time to pour into myself now so I'm ready for another relationship down the line.",

                "I found this section of an article very interesting.  It talks about the GLP-1 levels in different groups of people:\n\nDifferent physiological levels of GLP-1\n\nGLP-1 circulates at low concentrations in the blood, typically in the range of 0.9-18 pmol/L? Since the levels of GLP-1 in healthy individuals are low, there is a strong need for sensitive methods to accurately detect GLP-1 as a biomarker in human plasma, with a starting point below 1 pmol/L.\n\nIn certain patient groups, GLP-1 is present in abnormal concentrations. Patients which have undergone bariatric surgery show highly increased levels of GLP-1 after a meal; concentrations up to 300 pmol/L have been reported2526, Considering the unquestionable effect of bariatric surgery on GLP-1 levels in these individuals, combined with the fact that insulin levels normalize in most patients within days after surgery, long before any significant weight loss has occurred, it will be interesting to follow research in this field as more facts about GLP-1 and its actions are revealed. These findings will contribute to the understanding of how to develop better drugs for treatment of both diabetes and obesity, emphasizing the importance of accurate measurement of GLP-1.\n\nAnother patient group with reported abnormal GLP-1 levels is T2DM patients. However, the deviation, from normal levels, is far from what has been reported in the bariatric surgery patient population and not always consistent across studies. It has been suggested that it is not the fasting GLP-1 levels that differ between diabetic and normal glucose tolerant patients, but that the postprandial GLP-1 levels are significantly lower in the diabetic group 27,28. This implies that GLP-1 secretion is impaired in this group of patients.\n\nHere is the link to the full article:\n\nhttps://diagenics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/glp1-white-paper.pdf",
                "I also found this info on a C Peptide lab test which determines if a patient can benefit from a GLP-1 or DPP IV inhibitors. So I wonder if it can kind of be used in reverse to see if you are doing \"too good\" in a sense you are actually already on a GLP-1. \n\nHere is that info as well:\n\nWhy the Test is Performed\n\nC-peptide is measured to tell the difference between insulin the body produces and insulin that is injected into the body.\n\nSomeone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes may have their C-peptide level measured to see if their body is still producing insulin. C-peptide is also measured in case of low blood sugar to see if the person's body is producing too much insulin.\n\nThe test is also often ordered to check if certain medicines that can help the body produce more insulin, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs (GLP-1) or DPP IV inhibitors would work in an individual patient.\n\nThis is the link to the full article:\n\n https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/insulin-c-peptide-test",

I have a glass water bottle from Hydrojug but I only use that when I know I will drink the water in one sorting since it doesn't keep the water cold. That's awesome! I'm trying to eat more fruits and veggies as they make me feel better and cause less issues (diarrhea, constipation, etc.). \n\nWhat kind of cutting board did you buy? Also, how do you clean your veggies and fruits in bulk? I use FitWash spray but I go through that very quickly. I've used vinegar or baking soda sometimes as well.",

I need the inside connection on how to secure one during those Target launches haha",
                "Thanks for sharing that info. I've been using the Calory app and like it so far. They have a 7 day trial but I think I might buy the Lifetime as it's only $34.99 and I don't want to have to keep paying annually just to scan food. I use an app called Healthview which reads from my Apple Watch to see my Resting + Burned Calories = Total Calories and then I can see the foods entered on Calory as well. This helps me see my calorie deficit and net carotid which I really like. The Interface is really nice and it has Macros as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxavvcprhlmc1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7634a59dcf7e0dd5529dcd03aa72cc0b4d835e4d",

I was at Home Depot and saw a bunch of cool fruit trees but they are pricey. I saw plums, apples, bananas, kumquats, etc. for about $75 -$125 a piece. Scared to plant it and mess it up. Might do some research and plant closer to April.",

I like that you can also scan the label which makes adding new foods to the database easier and that it works with Apple Health so I can see everything in one place on my HealthView app. I added a pic of that app. I paid for the Lifetime for that one but forgot the price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mxhdzqksvlmc1.jpeg?width=1109&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=037e8d3ae6745ee92de51897b6c93fef7c1993a4",

                "Today I'm eating air puffs, water slushies, freshly made deep breaths, Wasser, and for dessert homemade ice. Mmm\n\n(This is a joke. I'm just drinking water at the moment. I will try for a light snack and then proceed from there.) \nI usually go with Belvita breakfast bars & Nature's Bakery stuff. Its easy for me to get down. For comfort I pick up mashed potatoes, applesauce, and crackers. I avoid all dairy and meat. They're harder to digest. Having ginger helps some people. Ginger tea. The old standby that doctors recommend is the BRATT diet. \nBananas\nRice\nApplesauce\nToast \nTea \nBut I don't suggest tea if you don't need it. Ginger tea is fine, but any main tea with caffeine could contribute to water loss. And we NEED to stay hydrated. This is very much like when I was pregnant. I kept some crackers by my bed and didn't leave my bed until I ate at least 1 cracker. For some reason it helps. I'm usually fine and have an appetite by 5pm, but yesterday was the 2nd shot of the 1.2 and I just don't feel ready for food today. I did well yesterday. Smoothies are good but I wouldn't add and dairy or yogurt. Maybe just a banana, ice, and some other fruits. I've found chopping up a banana into small bite sizes and freezing them is good for when I don't want to eat. Rice is a quick one too. I've noticed I have to eat slowly. If I eat at a pace like those around me, I tend to feel queasy afterwards. Slow pace, chew my food, and water water water. I wanted to devour a watermelon the other day, but I had to recognize my digestive system is slowed down.\ud83d\udc0c Couscous is another thing I enjoy. If I don't feel good it's usually got enough flavor and it has protein. Sorry you don't feel good. I'll share my air puffs with you.",
                "Yayyyy!! I'm so happy for you. It must feel so good to see and feel the progress. \nI'm terrified of going up to 2.4  I did my first 1.2 last week and I had to have a barf bag at the ready driving home. I made it, but at the beginning it was questionable. Today I fought off the nausea, but I'm still getting some body aches and pains. It seems like having something in my stomach does help. I usually take my current favorite Nature's Bakery Banana chocolate chip bar with me to eat after my blood is drawn. That or the Nature's Bakery fig bars. Even if I only eat a little bit, I think it's better than on an empty stomach. I had some Belvita breakfast bars but I only had 1 at breakfast and the 2nd at lunch and then 30 min later did my shot. I was being cautious so I wouldn't get sick. Last time I felt pain wash over my left ankle as soon as I administered the shot. I hope it continues to get easier. I inject in my thigh, which I think is best for me. I take the pepcid before my shot every time. I get reflux with each dose increase. It usually goes away after 36hrs. I started taking the medicine the first week of March. I was \"screened\" at the end of February. I think I'm 4 wks behind you. Great job on the weight loss! I hope my 2.4 increase isn't as bad as this hurdle was. And I PRAY I'm not in the 6.0 group. \ud83d\ude48",

They'll show a paper that has highlighted changes. The old info will have a line through it. So you'll still be able to see what was changed. They may not do this at every study though. It may be at select locations. The only changes were being reimbursed for a mini fridge and the trial being extended and a 2nd follow up added. I didn't see any medical changes. They may have added 2 more tablespoons of blood will be taken. Cas I think the original number was lower. I'll have to look. Something like 32 tbsp to 34 tbsp.",
                "That's interesting. So today when I put my shot in I could feel it hit my ankle and kinda wash over my body and it immediately gave a quick achy feeling. I fully expected my body would get really sore. I had the nausea medicine and didn't take it beforehand. As about 15-20 min went by and I got to my car, I was nauseous. I took the nausea medicine since I was worried I'd get sick while driving. It took 25-30 min to kick in, but once it did my nausea subsided. I could feel reflux trying to come up as well. I had taken pepcid before my shot, so it never got bad. By the time I got home and sat down, I was exhausted. I've had a crazy few days. Highly stressful. It's almost 8pm and it's been 8 hrs. I was able to eat a bit of toast & some rice pudding stuff when I got home. I haven't eaten since then. My arms and face have felt flushed this time. This one was a leap! I think I may get the runs, but I PRAY the nausea has subsided. I'll have to set up a whole routine for each week. I am concerned about tomorrow and if I'll feel sick again. Long story, but I'm using a loaner car. It's all I have. So I don't want to mess that car up.",
                "I ate a bit of rice pudding. For some reason it sounded good and that stayed down. I tried a piece of toast but I chocked on it a bit, so I gave up. I'm gonna try some yogurt with granola and hope that stays. I'm going to take it very slow. I usually let the granola sit in the yogurt so absorb some liquid and it makes a much softer granola. I need to get protein in. I haven't eaten any dairy other than yogurt and butter since I started the trial. I use Oat milk for everything. Cow milk makes me fill clogged in the arteries \ud83d\ude02",
                "Oh no! I take my 1.2 dose for the first time tomorrow around 11am. I'm really nervous for this one. I plan to take nausea medicine before the shot as well as some reflux medicine. I don't want to be sick going home or feel terrible. \n-How long after the shot did your side effects kick in?\n-Did you have side effects at the other doses?",
                "Sorry I got confused for a second, so you just finished the 1.2 dose and just this week went up to the 2.4? Did I get it right? \nYou know what I thought about was what if I'm in the 6.0 mg dose program!? \ud83d\ude2d I don't think I'd make it that high.",
                "Oh I'm hurting and so sore right now. It's been 10 hrs and I feel like I have the flu. Thankfully I was prepared and assumed this would happen, but I can't do the nausea and vomiting. \nThe thought of a dose being nearly 5x stronger is terrifying me. I think I'd collapse! They may need to keep me at this dose for 2 months. My body is angry with me. I'm taking pepcid every 12 hrs. I'd have to take the whole bottle of Pepcid at 6mg! \ud83d\ude02 \nI asked for a copy of my bloodwork since I have hypothyroidism and my CK came back low. Kinda made me nervous cas that blood test refers to low muscle strength, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. I do have a Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, but I've never been told it was close to RA or Lupus. What I have is just an umbrella term for bits and pieces of an autoimmune disorder but not one that damages my body. So that made me a tiny bit nervous. Hopefully that improves.",

The best part is that I can scan any food barcode and it automatically puts in the serving size and amount. I don't have to weigh anything. Many restaurant meals and other things are already listed so I can search them up quickly. It also tracks my weight, my exercise, and my steps. I connected my free step tracker and I can easily add my exercise and weight. I know exactly how many calories I have remaining after eating, and what type of food I should aim for. It also subtracts or adjusts the food intake based on my activities.",

I guess I need to speed up but not too fast. Cas it does burn if I go too fast. My nurse said go at the speed I'm comfortable with, but I feel like I shake when I go slow.

I do feel a bit of room in some things. \nAs far as calories I can't eat anymore than that. It's hard some days to get 1200 calories a day. What's funny is my primary doctor said it wasn't possible for me to not be loosing weight is I was eating under 1200 calories. The dietician I saw (before the trial) said it may be that I wasn't eating enough. So it's interesting you mention that too.",

I think I'm so lost in trying so hard to eat well and move that I forget there's a medicine involved in all this. Thank you, and thanks for reminding me. Good luck with your water. I sprinkle a bit of crystal light in my water sometimes. It's like getting a special treat. I love cold water too. I got a special bottle for my water. If I don't think about the water and I just drink when I'm thirsty, I don't think about how much I need to drink. I had to do some water taste tests. I taste differences in water. To me well water was the best tasting, but I work with what I can get on sale. Good Luck \u2618\ufe0f",
                "I wouldn't say I had nausea, but I did have acid reflux. Have you tried taking an antacid? Usually on shot day I take some Pepcid. If it's only happening when you're lying down, it definitely sounds like reflux. \nSorry, I shouldn't act like I know about what you're going through. My advice comes from having Irritable Bowel Syndrome and GERD (reflux) for over 20 years. I actually had what's called a ph study done before I started the trial. I was waking up with what felt like vomit in my throat. I'm a side and stomach sleeper. I'm sharing what my doctor told me. When you're lying down, the acid can come back up. The best thing for acid is laying on your left side with extra pillows, or your bed raised a bed. I ordered a wedge pillow off of Amazon, and it's really helped when my reflux is bad. I'm against PPIs like prilosec because studies have shown that long-term effects can mess with your bones. Anyway, the rules for reflux are to avoid spicy foods, don't eat 3 hours before bed, and recline your bed. If your doctor says it's OK, I'd use Pepcid. You can get 10 or 20mg. You take it every 12 hours. My study doctor and nurse have told me reflux is a listed (known) side effect. It may be messing with your stomach. If you feel sick all the time, it could just be the medicine. An antacid could help, but you may need to speak to them and explain the nausea. They may be able to give you something for it. I hope you feel better.\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

                "Yea, that's true. This is my first ever clinical trial. I'm going into this blindly. I keep forgetting it's double blind so nobody actually knows anything. I'm only finishing week 3. Doing my 4th shot tomorrow, so I assume I'll be going up in dosage next week. Down 10 or 11 lbs, so I hope the higher dose doesn't give me awful side effects. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4f",
                "I'm in my 3rd week and am 95% sure I'm on Survodutide. I know my body so I could feel the medicine going into my system. I usually have soreness at the injection site, some slight body aches & a slight headache. I see food and have no interest in it. I now like lettuce and fresh fruit. I avoid dairy and switched to Oat Milk. My appetite has plummeted. If I don't eat soon enough I feel weak and unwell. I try to eat 3 meals a day, but sometimes I just can't eat. The week before I started the trial I was going through a rough time. I remember eating 2 \u00bd fresh donuts and hating myself afterwards. I felt like I ate so much sugar and fat. If you had told me that a week from that day, I would no longer crave junk, I wouldn't have believed you. I don't eat anything fried. I'm not craving donuts. I don't crave junk food. I have been having some weak moments late at night for the past 2 days. But even if I eat, I still don't hit my calorie goal. I don't exactly feel hungry when I late night snack. So I'm kind of confused as to why I'm eating. Healthy food is very expensive. When I don't have the money to restock, I struggle to find anything appealing. \nI think for me, the cravings stopped. I felt and noticed a difference in my body. I think if you write down anything you feel for 24 hours after your injection, you may notice the side effects. Really focus on how you feel. Compare your injection day to the day before your injection. You may see a pattern of side effects. It also may be your dose isn't high enough. PMS or your period do change your hormones, so it might be that too.",
                "I looked into this as well, but I vaguely remember seeing that the P stood for something related to the type of trial or this specific trial. It didn't mean placebo.

I have a weird schedule so I could easily skip breakfast. I've always felt sick when drinking a protein shake or homemade shake in the morning. I feel like I've lost a bit of energy because I don't have enough calories. It could still be getting over the cold, but I want to be as accurate as I can be. I'm down 7lbs.

I eat chicken and occasionally turkey or ham, but that's my main protein. I hardly ever have red meat. I only eat ground beef or a tiny burger. But I haven't had beef in over a month now. I was thinking of a tuna salad on lettuce, but I wasn't sure what would be the best way to make it. Mayo isn't healthy & I don't know much about vegan mayonnaise. I don't want to waste money on it & hate it. I also have digestive issues. Normally I'm going to the bathroom all day, but the medicine has helped to regulate me. I don't drink coffee or have any caffeine. Citrus is hard on my stomach. I'm a mess\ud83d\ude02 I'd love to know what you use or buy for your chicken and tuna salad. I'll try to grab some stuff tomorrow. I keep craving chickpeas and I munch on those. My calorie intake was supposed to stay below 1700. Daily I'm getting about 1100 calories or less. I have had a cold all week too. I didn't take anything for it other than 1 advil. I don't want anything to interfere with the medicine. Since I know I'm on it, I'm trying to be fair to the trial and also be accurate about what they want for us to do. I'm still full from the smoothie I had a while ago. I want something else in my mind, but I also am able to negotiate with my mind. If I eat something now, I'll feel sick. So it's feel sick or not. I choose not to feel sick.\ud83d\ude02 Before I would've eaten with no ability to realize I'll feel sick. I also have plenty of calories left if I do decide to eat. After my walk, I just wasn't interested in eating very much. I also have not craved sweets. I appreciate them and their smells, but I'm not shoving it in my mouth. I want to stick to high protein, tasty but not bad for me, meals. Tuna and chicken salad are great ideas.",

My doctor wrote it down so, I guess I may be an abnormal anomaly? Lol I don't feel like I have had as much loss of food interest, but I'm struggling to get enough calories. I'm drinking my water, but I eat a protein bar or breakfast thing in the AM. I usually have a simple lunch. Like fruit, chickpeas, grapes and yogurt. Dinner is a veggie and protein. What I didn't realize is that I was giving myself my shot on an empty stomach. I have to fast before my trial visit, so my 1st shot was on an empty stomach. 2nd shot I fasted too, cas for some reason I thought I had to.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I didn't do the shot till 1pm. I'm wondering if my empty stomach enhanced the side effects.I can feel the medicine enter my system. It kinda feels weird for a minute. I'm going to eat this coming Tuesday before my shot and see if it's better. I have a virtual visit. I also noticed I lost a drop of medicine cas my hand was shaky from not eating. I seem to jab myself rather hard. \ud83d\ude02 I don't know why either. The needles are painless. I can give other people shots & draw blood, but on myself I'm brutal. Maybe I'm too hungry & need to get a better hold on it all. I'm not used to injecting myself with anything.",
                "What's interesting is on the MyFitnessPal app, is says I'm eating tons of fiber. I think it was just an adjustment time mixed with PMS. I did pick up the generic one from Costco you recommended so if it becomes an issue again, I'll definitely start adding it in. Thanks for telling me where you got yours. That always helps. \ud83e\udd70",
                "I'm around 64oz or more a day. Then I have 16oz of ice. I'm better now. It may have just been an adjustment to the heavy protein or PMS. But I'm back to regular now. I'll be taking my second shot tomorrow so I hope it goes better. Then I'll be able to say for sure it was the Crestor that made my body ache. \n\nThe only issue now is I have a cold. I haven't taken anything for it cas I don't know what's safe. I would normally take Advil cold & sinus at night, but I'm trying to get by without taking anything. I can't stop sneezing. This cold comes with a nose tickle. I have a deviated septum from my nose getting broken. I end up with lots of sinus infections, but I hope I don't get one. I'll check in with my trial doctor tomorrow if it's not better. But I'm definitely on the trial medicine. For other meds like Mounjaro, online it says Advil Cold & Sinus can raise your heart rate, but otherwise I don't see any interactions. It's hard to know with a trial medication. \nOne thing that is a guarantee is the stench of protein flatulence. WOW That can clear a room! \ud83d\ude02",
                "Yeah regarding the decongestant you're right. The Sudafed part of it can do that. \nI did question if it was allergies, but my allergies don't usually present with this many sneezes. I nornally sneeze 1-2x a day, but I've been sneezing like 25+ times a day. My son brought this lovely cold home. He gave it to someone else who is also excessively sneezing. I think it's just the way the cold is. It tickles your nose. I normally like to have fun with my sneezes. I challenge myself to try and say something when I sneeze. Sometimes it's hilarious, sometimes it's awkward. It's how I deal with my allergies. Now I'm too busy covering my nose to have fun with sneezes. I have a headache, sneezing, and nasal congestion. My allergies usually involve runny eyes and I don't have that yet. I was cleared to take my CBD/THC gummies, so I may use that for the headache. Lol I was surprised but they didn't say I had to stop it. I use it for Fibromyalgia but it hasn't been as bad lately. It tends to flare on its own schedule.",
                "Do you feel fairly confident you don't have the placebo?",
                "I started the Crestor last night. I didn't have any symptoms before my injection. The burning like or warm throat and left leg aching only started after the shot. I thought maybe I grabbed my leg too hard, but it's actually achy in a wider area. I didn't jab myself hard since I'm a phlebotomist, but I went quick. I love my nurse, she's so sweet. She said \"Geez I blinked, and you had it in already,\" I told her I couldn't do it slowly on myself. It's weird, I struggle to inject myself because it's not a slow entry like a phlebotomy needle. I had her demonstrate the force and we both laughed. I said that seemed way too weak. Thankfully the actual shot didn't hurt at all. I did feel this weird surge like feeling go all the way to my head. Like whatever it was, went all throughout my body. I think my right leg would be sore as wel, if it was from the Crestor. I keep telling myself to assume it's placebo until I get further along. I'm just happy it went well. My nerves were calm and I wasn't freaking out. I thought I might have a panic attack while driving there. It was rainy and I didn't feel like going.\nI think the stomach injections are harder to tell as far as muscular or aching discomfort. My thigh has way more muscle and it's solid. My stomach is a flabby blob. Lol If these side effects subside and then come back again with my next injection I think I'll know more. I read about people on the other GLP1 meds feeling side effects kick in on the 2nd & 3rd day. I was in a group on FB thinking I'd start Wegovy but never got approved. I was too scared to take a compound version, so this is my first GLP1 type med. If the aching never subsides, it's probably the cholesterol medicine. Time will tell I guess. Meanwhile I'm trying to figure out some way to test a teenie tiny drop to see if it's placebo. \ud83d\ude02",
                "Right? \ud83d\ude02 I was looking up if there was a way to see if saline would react with 1 other compound. My thinking was if the tiny drop left in a needle reacted with another liquid or something I would be able to tell if it was saline or not. Lol I was acting like I know what I'm doing. I don't. \ud83d\ude02",
                "As I get closer to my first injection (a few days) I keep trying to accept that I am going to get the placebo. I feel like expecting to get the placebo will help my mind not think about side effects. It sure is annoying to feel like I NEED to eat, when I don't. Maybe stress triggers that. Having a family member almost die 2 weeks ago hasn't helped either. In some ways, I'm frustrated that after waiting for a trial & giving so much blood, I could ultimately get saline.\ud83d\ude02 On the other hand, I know I'm helping with scientific research. \nI can't get the app MyFitnessPal to pair my steps from Samsung Health. I also did 1 day of what I ate and it said I ate over 1,470 calories. Before, I was eating the normal 2000. Maybe I set my goal too high for weight loss, so they're saying to eat even less? \nDue to stomach issues, I can't eat popcorn and most nuts. I can't think of anything calorie free to eat. I don't know what to eat. I'm hoping my appetite will go away, but I'm also realizing it might not.\nI'm sure, like many of you, we want to have success and feel better overall. Sadly, some of us will get the placebo. I wish I could get rid of the feeling I need to eat when I don't. I drink water all day & that gets boring. If I'm on the placebo, I don't know what I'll do. I've been to 4 different specialists to try to figure out why I can't lose weight. Maybe the frustration of getting the placebo will lower my appetite.\ud83d\ude02\nI have a family member's wedding to go to in May. I truly don't want to go if I'm at my current weight. I'm ashamed. I don't want to be in photos. I cry when I get into my car after seeing myself in a store mirror or reflection. I feel disgusting. Does anyone else ever feel like they're in a sort of fat suit? It's hard carrying around excess weight. It doesn't feel like me. Having 2 chins & fat just plopped onto my body. I know I'm working myself up to disappointment, but I feel like I should prepare for it. What a wonderful surprise and help it would be if I actually was able to lose some weight. \nI appreciate all of you so much. I need people who understand around me. I hope we all find success even if we do get a placebo. \ud83e\udd0d",
                "Oh that will be interesting. Some people in other trials and in phase 2, mentioned it took a day or 2 before they noticed side effects. I had joined a Facebook group last year where people were talking about Wegovy & Mounjaro. I thought I would eventually get it covered. I learned a lot in that group. My only concern with survodutide (I still struggle spelling that right. Lol) was that the side effects were at 24% or something at the higher doses. \nI wish there was a way to test a tiny drop & see if we had the placebo or not. The first month wouldn't matter, but if I wasn't losing weight and I wasn't on the placebo, I'd be concerned. Did I mention I can't do much other than walking since I have a broken tailbone? \ud83d\ude02 Fun times around my home. \nI had a yogurt & a sandwich today and myfitnesspal said it was too many calories.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I've been trying to familiarize myself with the apps and the study app. There isn't much to do yet though. Does anyone know if they ever show you your blood test results if you ask for them? Do you know of anyone who was denied the trial after the screening? I wonder what they're looking for in the blood & urine screening besides the obvious.",
                "Thank you for the welcome! \nI'm fairly sure I'll know if I have the drug or not. I'm very in tune with my body & I'm on medications for IBS. Even if there were no side effects, I will be able tell by whether or not my desire to eat has gone away. \nWe joke that after all this & a year of fighting insurance, I'll get the placebo.\ud83d\ude02 \nI've had a lot of stress lately & 1 of my parents just had a few strokes. So my comfort was unknowingly snacking and eating. I would go eat carrots at 1am. My diet is fairly good. I saw a ton of specialists since I couldn't get weight off. I did fasting & phentermine a while back. That was awful. It left me with an elevated heart rate. I always seem to worry about my heart now. I get anxious palpitations now, which I never used to get. I also get them when I get my heart rate up too high. I think my problem has been eating 1 or 2 meals a day. I might need to have small things all throughout the day. \nI really felt fat today. I was uncomfortable with my appearance and just felt like I'm carrying around a fat suit. I hate being this big. Even if I do lose 2-4lbs it comes right back.\nRegarding the injection, I know how to do it, but I don't know how I'll do the actually pushing in of the needle. (I work with needles.) It's different when it's your own body. I'm curious to see if they'll let us change the location. It's mentioned that the doctor may do that at some point, but maybe this company wants it done specifically in the stomach. From what I read about the phase 2 trial, people had too many side effects at the higher doses. They didn't titrate it slow enough. I'm not sure how long your study is, but mine is 76 weeks. Guess I should get to know everyone. Lol"

I do a protein shake with my iced coffee each morning at 170 calories and 30 grams of protein. For lunch today I had 4 slices of honey ham(140 calories and 20g protein) and a large orange (87 calories and 1.7 grams protein). Dinner was 6 oz of Bare Chicken chunks ( 320 calories and 31g protein) and Iike 15 spears of asparagus (75 calories and 6g protein). I\u2019ll have my weekend late night snack of a nature valley protein bar (190 calories and 10g protein) to round up my day. The bars not the best protein bar choice but it has chocolate so it cures my mild sweet tooth and gives me that last bit of protein to get me to a 100g for the day. Oh yeah and 1 tbs of Mike\u2019s hot honey for the nuggets. During the week I mostly eat tuna salads for lunch for protein. Or chicken salad. That protein shake is the real thing that helps me hit that mark for sure tho. And I buy the premade shakes cuz when I\u2019ve made them from powder I  find them just to be disgusting for whatever reason.",

But I also told myself even if I did receive the placebo at least I\u2019m trying to make a rather drastic lifestyle change for the better. And joining the trial gives me motivation to put as much effort in as possible. Drug or no drug. Because let\u2019s be honest we still need to put in A LOT of work. I\u2019m on a 1200 calorie diet and working as hard as I can to get my exercise in. Which two months ago I would have laughed at that while binging and watching tv. The shots not pure magic.

                "Hi! Don\u2019t be worried! Honestly the hardest part for me is getting the exercise in lol. I get my 5th dose tomorrow morning which is titrating up. I\u2019ve really had no side effects. I actually feel better now than I did before joining the trial! Hopefully that\u2019s not because it\u2019s the placebo \ud83e\udd23. Heartburns gone, but also try not to eat after 6:30 so that may be helping. I have had diarrhea a couple times and a couple headaches. But I actually think it\u2019s from eating 5 day old rotisserie chicken each time. And the headaches are probably from allergies. As far as diet MyFitnessPal put me at 1410 calories (I have no idea why it\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve used it)and Ive just ran with that. I\u2019m not saying I can ALWAYS stick to it but I sure am trying. I find I try to do more protein so I\u2019ve been mixing premier protein shakes with either fruit and yogurt for a smoothie or tossing in a caramel one with cold brew each day. As far as the needle it\u2019s so tiny and you just stick it in, there\u2019s nothing scary about it. If you don\u2019t sign up for the optional study (where they tell you where to stick it) then you can stick in belly, thigh or upper arm. It\u2019s up to you, it doesn\u2019t always have to be the same place. I weigh in tomorrow but the 3 previous weeks I\u2019ve lost almost 10lbs total, so I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s not placebo but I wouldn\u2019t kind some side effects with titrating up tomorrow just to make me feel better about it\ud83d\ude02. My one suggesting is to track your food everyday. The food journal is doing the minimum requirement and I believe that if I didn\u2019t track everything everyday then I wouldn\u2019t be as successful.

I didn\u2019t feel the need to add cheese and toppings or cook a whole meal. It was more a feeling of I should eat something good for me. And really it was probably too much cause I feel stuffed.

No weight loss though lol and definitely no suppression of appetite. The other day I completely failed. Probably the worst meal day I've had in years. I had carne asada fries for lunch, bubble tea as dessert, then I was running errands and was at Target around dinner time and happened to walk by the Snack station... saw one of those pizza hut pepperoni pizzas, and I caved despite all the crap I ate earlier that day. Super embarrassed to admit that.... but willing to admit it anonymously on Reddit lol",

This morning I'm at 215.4 lb, so I'm headed back down in the right direction.

I think it's from the first dose.\n\nI think for this trial, they probably just dosed patients at the final dosage level (so no priming period at lower doses like we are going through). So for example, participants in the 3.6 mg arm of the study immediately got a 3.6 mg injection on the first day (Week 0).\n\nThe common issue with this for all of the GLP-1RA agonists is the side effects (nausea, vomiting, bowel distress, etc...), which is the reasoning for the long dose-escalation schedule that we have for the SYNCHRONIZE trials. Because they find that priming patients at lower doses and titrating up reduces the incidence of adverse events.",
                "I think the data indicates a higher dose might have a greater effect (hence the reason for a 6.0 mg dosage arm in the phase 3 studies), and weight change has not plateaued yet, meaning there could be even more weight loss over a longer study period.",

And injuries are no joke. I had a lot of injuries last year that set me back. I walk around outside but also do go to the gym, so I don't have too many suggestions. If you do decide to get a gym membership, I walk on an incline to get my heart rate up, without having to run and therefore put stress on my knees. Ellipitcal is also very low impact. But I guess both of those require a gym membership unless you have a machine at home.",

Reasons to think I'm on Survodutide: My resting heart rate when I wake up is usually around 60 BPM. I haven't been wearing my AppleWatch to sleep, but last night I did out of curiosity. My heart rate only got down to 70 BPM. I believe, on average, people on the drug saw an increase of 8 BPM. But then again, I went to sleep hours after I normally do bc I took a nap late in the day.

Man that stuff worked but I have used it a few different times and it is no longer effective for me.\n\nI am still hoping I am on the real thing but week 1 I lost 2 lbs, week 2 no weight change and week 3 gained 2lbs so basically no change so far. \n\nI also struggle with sticking to my food goals. You\u2019re not alone!",
                "Congrats on doing your first shot!\n\nI think you mentioned being nervous about it but you did it! \n\nI also felt like I had burping the first week I took my 4th dose today so next week when they up my dosage I hope to feel something a little more. \n\nI think no matter what it would be common for the injection site to be a little achy since it\u2019s not like we get shots there normally. \n\nHow long ago did you start the crestor? If you didn\u2019t have those side effects before the shot I would think they would be from the shot and not crestor! Unless you started both today then who knows haha.",
                "When you did mounjaro did you feel EXHAUSTED? I only did it for 3 weeks because even the lowest dose my gastro issues were terrible but I also had the worst fatigue ever",
                "I have no idea. Right now if I had to choose I would say I got the placebo. Besides the burping and a random night I up with the mildest acid reflux I have not felt any difference. I lost 2 lbs the first week then nothing, last week I GAINED 2 lbs. \n\nI know I have work to do with my activity and being more stringent on my diet so it\u2019s really hard to say. \n\nI\u2019m just hoping this new med has less side effects and that\u2019s why I feel normal so far haha",
                "Oh man! Ugh yea I was worried that when I did compounded wegovy (for 2.5 months) that I would feel exhausted but luckily I didn\u2019t",
                "Hahah that\u2019s why I spent so much time trying to decipher the boxes. But I guess we just keep waiting\u2026 68 weeks but who\u2019s countinf",

Oh but I just looked in the pamphlet and it looks like it will always say .5ml but the concentration changes  \n\nThat\u2019s what I see on the syringe when I undo all the wrapping (as instructed) to make sure there\u2019s no cracks",
                "lol well I am dumb cause each box has a different med number hahah so that must be unique to each dose",

I woke up a few hours later and had some acid reflux (very mild) but hoping it is the real thing! I titrate on 3/12 so hopefully I\u2019ll feel something then!!",

                "Hi and welcome!\n\nI would ask the person at the location you are doing the trial what their guidelines are for medications. \n\nI asked about zofran and they shared they would consult with the dr if I asked for it and felt I needed it. I take my 3rd shot tomorrow and have not needed it yet. \n\nFrom what I saw and signed there was nothing saying we could not discuss the trial :) I have been giving myself the shots, its not ad at all. When you go in for your appointment they should show you how to inject it. I would ask them to walk you through the steps then have them watch you inject it yourself so you know how to do it. \n\nYou should also have a meeting with a dietician to review your eating habits but my big takeaway was to eat more protein to help with satiety.\n\nAll of us have had relatively mild side effects and have no idea whether we are on the real drug or the placebo so welcome to the guessing game!",

I guess the study schedule I got does just say \u201cdiet and physical activity counseling\u201d\n\nProtein is hard because I don\u2019t love chicken but I like the fairlife shakes (30g) as well as chobani complete yogurt drinks (20g) \n\nThe dietician I met with said the goal should be 30g of protein per meal",

                "Oh they have good ones! I think I got my membership for like $20",
                "I thought it was weird too? I am on levothyroxine for my thyroid and they gave me a copy of my results to share with my dr cause it was off a little. \n\nBut they mentioned they saw what it was previously so I am thinking maybe they had access to my labs my dr has ordered? I know I have had A1C checked in the past and it was within range on the screening labs too",
                "Thank you!\n\nI guess I am just comparing it to tirzepatide and semaglutide which I both felt effects with the lowest dose.",
                "Congrats! I did my second yesterday. Nothing really noticeable other than I go from hungry then almost overly full very quickly lol",
                "Nice! Tomorrow will be my second dose. I\u2019ve had some diarrhea probably because I am not eating as well as I should be over the weekend. \n\nHopefully next week when you increase dose you will feel SLIGHTLY more? Haha I hate to wish side effects on somene",
                "I\u2019m in the same boat. \n\nI\u2019m relieved I guess that the side effects are not so severe for anyone!\n\nFor me I still can be either \u201cnormal\u201d hungry then just not. I mainly just have burping but that\u2019s not consistent either ahah",
                "Did anyone else sign up for the \u201coptional\u201d parts?\n\nI did all of them haha. Had my MRI and got to pick where to inject. I chose my leg!",

The starting dose we are taking is .3, wegovy is .25 and mounjaro is .5. \n\nI tried mounjaro (October 2022) but quit after 3 weeks of horrible vomiting and nausea. I did 2.5 months of compounded sema and only ever had the lowest dose with a little bit of nausea but lots of fullness. \n\nMaybe this drug just has less side effects?\n\nI do wonder that after a few months if I think I have the placebo I will want to keep going with the trial\u2026.",
