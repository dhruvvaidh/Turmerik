                "honestly i think the thing that many sites and even some crassponsor staff dont understand is that protocol deviations are not automatically a horrible thing or something to take personally \n\nthey literally exist to identify where the data didnt follow the stated protocol which is important because your handing a huge protocol to regulators, scientists, physicians and other people that care about your data and you\u2019re saying \u201cwe ran this study on x number of subjects based on these exact parameters\u201d and protocol deviations are how you identify anywhere and everywhere those exact parameters weren\u2019t true. \n\nwhich is a very important part of the scientific method for many reasons, but mainly for reproducibility of results. \n\nany study involving real people is going to have deviations. in fact, it\u2019s a huge red flag if it doesn\u2019t. and yes, sites and sponsors both have to try and follow the protocol to the best of their ability, but shit happens. the important part is documenting what happened and why, and periodically reviewing to see if there are trends that are occurring that indicate poor procedures at the site, a poorly devised protocol, bad vendor processes, etc.\n\njust like we expect sites to identify deviations and take corrective and preventative measures for significant or repeated issues, regulators also hold sponsors accountable if there are widespread deviations that indicate study procedures aren\u2019t able to be followed by sites, and the sponsor did nothing to address the issue. \n\ni get push back nearly everyday from sites when they get a deviation because a subject was out of town and didn\u2019t do their visit in window, or they couldn\u2019t collect a pk in time because the subjects veins were bad and they couldn\u2019t get a stick, or other similar things. they feel like \u201cwell it\u2019s not our fault, so it\u2019s not a deviation\u201d. but that\u2019s not how deviations work. they simply indicate where the protocol was not followed, regardless of fault. \n\nyou discuss fault when you take and document corrective and preventative actions, which you cannot do if you don\u2019t address that there was a deviation in the first place. \n\nit really is so refreshing when people understand the purpose of deviations is not to \u201ctell on you\u201d or \u201cmake you look bad\u201d or any number of other things that i\u2019ve heard people say in response to being issued a very clear deviation. \n\nsites that identify and document when a deviation occurs, and take quick corrective and preventative actions to address them are worth their weight in gold and also seem to have much happier, less stressed out staff.",
                "i totally get that part completely i was a crc for many years and had to deal with hospital staff that had the same apathy towards research \n\nits why i personally find hospital sites to not be desirable if you can avoid using them on your study the staff is too large too busy and the pis often dont do their job of ensuring appropriate oversight although that part happens at most sites these days it seems).",
                "yeah the icf one happens a lot and is down to cras and other clin ops people just not understanding how things work at all some of them just look at the irb approval date and compare that to the date of study visits not realizing that they have to look at the irb approval letter date instead and even then theres a level of common sense required \n\nbut this is why many sites have an sop that outlines the process for implementing amended icfs it does protect them from these types of unnecessary pds sites that have experience under their belt will have an sop that says something like \u201cupon receipt of irb-approved icf, the consent will be distributed to the pi and study team by regulatory coordinator and the staff will have up to 2 business days to review the consent for training purposes, before it is implemented at the site and used to consent/re-consent study subjects.\u201d these sites will also have a consent log or other documentation that shows \u201cdate of implementation\u201d of the consent, and that should be the date it was truly distributed and ready to be used to consent study subjects.",
                "thats why i said if you can avoid using them on your study i agree a lot of protocols are poorly written but a lot of the things that were mentioned in regards to hospital staff not wanting to follow a protocol arent going to be fixed by writing better protocols \n\nevery countryhospitalclinical team/investigator has their own standard of care for certain processes, so it\u2019s not possible to write a protocol that fits what the clinical staff does in normal practice and you have to have standard procedures across sites for many things in a clinical trial. \n\nso the issues expressed with the hospital staff aren\u2019t ever going to be addressed just by writing better protocols. they have to be addressed by insisting that clinical staff that do any study procedures understand the importance of and reasons for following the protocol and  research admin teams building a culture of compliance from the clinical staff. \n\nit\u2019s actually pretty wild how much each site varies in what they want in a protocol. every siv, i have sites that say \u201cthat\u2019s stupid why would they do it like that\u201d only for the next siv with the next site to have them say \u201cfinally, i\u2019m so glad you guys require it like that because that\u2019s how we do it\u201d. i run into these same types of things all of the time, and i think sites underestimate how different each site and each country operates. \n\nwhat\u2019s a \u201cgood\u201d protocol to your site, is a \u201cbad\u201d protocol to another site, and also doesn\u2019t mean it will align with what regulators requires",

                "yeah then i think youll be fine a lot of times the monitor just has to push back with info and then the team in charge of deviations can just be slow to make a final decision a lot of studies only do pd review meetings quarterly so thats when they will likely get all the shareholders together present the background info and get their ok to remove it",
                "but it does impact the data thats just it when you have a protocol thats been approved by the regulators and irb it has to be followed end of any half decent investigator should understand that \n\nif investigators dont like a protocol, they should refuse to do the study. federal regulations, gcp, the contract they sign, and the 1572 they sign all say that they will follow the protocol as written, except in very specific circumstances to protect subjects. \n\nthey have no right to not follow the protocol because they don\u2019t think it impacts the data. it very much does. \n\nyou brought the problem up, and it is a real problem. a lot of staff that straddle both worlds (clinical and research) seem to have very poor understanding of how research actually works and the consequences of their actions. they also tend to value clinical work much higher, which means research often gets put on the back burner, deprioritized, or requirements are treated more like suggestions. \n\nnot following the protocol has a very detrimental impact on the data. data is often thrown out because the protocol was not followed. regulators and sponsors take it very seriously. investigators can be blacklisted, lose their license, even be jailed (in extreme cases of blatant fraud). \n\ni will repeat again: i agree that many, if not most, protocols are poorly written and sponsors must do better. but the way to handle that as an investigator/site is to vet studies well during feasibility and startup and refuse to take on studies that you know you can\u2019t be compliant with.\n\nnumber 1 because investigators/sites are required to follow the protocol by law and by contract and the consequences to themselves and to the sponsor are very bad when they don\u2019t and number 2 because the most effective way to get sponsors to write better protocols is when they can\u2019t find any sites to take their studies because their protocols are shit.",
                "highly recommend using the resources from the society of clinical research sites scrs they have amazing courses to introduce research naive investigators and coordinators to clinical research concepts \n\nas a side note they have a great conference they do each year that is a great way for sites to learn great infotips and network with companies and other sites\n\neta here\u2019s the link to the training modules from scrs website.\n\n\n\nadditionally, i believe it\u2019s usc has a program for regulatory science or something similar, and they have some great online trainings related to that program."

                "like many others here i kind of fell into cr i got an internship working a clinical trial in grad school and liked it a lot especially the data side \n\ni was open to whatever the public health field had to offer in terms of full time employment but as many here have stated those opportunities open up based on funding and being in the right place at the right time- all luck. i applied to dozens of those jobs and talked to anyone i could get (on the phone or even traveling to meet in person) with no luck for 6 months. desperate to do something, i accepted an interview to work in oncology trails at a local hospital. the pay and hours were awful, but i learned a lot and worked with several cros and sponsors. from there, it was easy to propel into a role with them for much higher pay. why not?\n\nthere\u2019s limitless opportunity in cr. it\u2019s not a perfect industry, but i was able to apply my skills and quickly work my way up. the mph definitely helped get me interviews and more senior positions with higher starting salaries. do you need one? certainly not- one of my favorite coworkers has a bs in english but started on the bottom and worked her way up to where she is now. as with any industry, your degree just sets your starting point. \n\nhope this helps- good luck!"

                "i have been personally impressed with most of the exus colleagues that i have worked with but most of these are at the clinops management level so the view may be skewed  the business opsfinance interactions i have had with exus teams have been more challenging\n\nhowever i will say that there are a couple of variables that i believe directly affect the quality of these newly outsourced teams and are not simply just the geography:\n\n1. companies are laying folks off before or concurrently with the hiring of these outsourced teams.  this gets rid of many resources that could effectively train these new teams, and instead, they get left without proper training.\n\n2. timezones: a geography based issue, but also half-due to industry processes.  on the business ops side at least, we have deliverable deadlines, and those deliverables require (typically) multiple levels and/or rounds of review.  this means if an ex-us resource/team is assigned on the deliverables, it could take up to twice as long since issues cannot be resolved throughout the day with active feedback, assuming us reviewers. additionally, the timezones affect attendance for meetings which causes a lack of alignment at times. some ex-us resources work abnormal hours to account for this, but not all. \n\n3. management: if an ex-us team has us management/leadership, then the 2 above issues are amplified\n\n4. language barrier, as others have stated, but this is becoming less and less of an issue.\n\n5. intra-industry movement - this is more speculation, but i believe it will become an issue over time. one of the biggest benefits of this industry is the fluidity of its workforce, a benefit for both employers and employees.  with outsourcing increasing, this increases competition in the labor force and could make it more difficult to land a job at a competitor since equally qualified, cheaper resources, potentially with less tenure in the industry, can be hired.  specific to the employers, this could stifle the flow of information, experiences, lessons from failures, new processes, new efficiencies, etc from company to company.\n\njust my thoughts/observations.  do i think it\u2019s a death sentence to companies that outsource? no.  however, the consequences of the decision to do so will be felt further down the line, and i do not believe it will be worth the cost-savings being experienced currently.",

                "i know my team would really respect a cra who asks us how to pronounce a word instead of just pronouncing it incorrectly throughout like it would warrant a whole conversation about how awesome our cra is for admitting to us they didnt know and asking and how we look forward to working with them because of it \n\nwere a teaching hospital and we value humility and asking questions pretending to know things you dont know is seen as egotistical and a dangerous red flag",

                "i realize that some sites are just condescending but i do also think that any pushback from sites on anything is often taken as condescension andor arrogance were almost universally viewed as beneath you and we are supposed to put our heads down and do as we are told no matter how stupid it is and when we don\u2019t, we\u2019re a problem. so just remember whenever a site acts that way, they\u2019ve probably been treated that way too many times and that\u2019s how they\u2019ve learned to interact with you. it\u2019s not right and i\u2019m not defending it, but everyone needs to be the change they want to see here.",

                "yep recruitment and retention procedures not respecting our startup processes timelines and budget requirements that are totally out of our control travel reimbursement for subjects is a huge one in my realm and also sponsors always complain first about what we ask in our budgets for crc time literally devaluing us and the time we spend on their studies \n\nthe big one though the one that really feels like blatant disrespect that has had me ready to leave research altogether more than once, is taking forever to answer questions that we need to have answered in order to move forward and then turning around and pestering us relentlessly- sometimes even berating us- if we let anything sit for a minute because we can\u2019t just drop everything we\u2019re doing and jump when the sponsor finally answers us. this occurs throughout the study, not just during startup. and we\u2019re usually already totally over it by the time the study starts- with years ahead of dealing with this sponsor that has already ruined their relationship with us. \n\ni really don\u2019t think a lot of people in industry are truly aware of the fact that site staff, especially those that are experienced and knowledgeable, are probably the scarcest of all resources in research. they are universally spread incredibly thin and are probably either burned out already or are working very hard to protect their energy (i.e. setting boundaries with demanding, unappreciative sponsors) so they don\u2019t burn out.\n\nthere\u2019s a huge cultural difference between industry and academia, and unfortunately there are a lot of aspects of industry culture that are totally incompatible with academia, and bridging that gap seems to fall on the site staff way too often. some people on the industry side do get it, but there are certainly way too many who don\u2019t.",

                "oh yeah i definitely prefer to have a draft doa ready to go and again we really prefer pis to hold off on signing a doa log until the siv is completed  but it is a gold standard preference not a requirement \n\nfda guidance on the doa states \u201cthe investigator should maintain a list of the appropriately qualified persons to whom significant trial-related duties have been delegated. this list should also describe the delegated tasks, identify the training the individuals have received that qualifies them to perform delegated tasks (e.g. can refer to an individual\u2019s cv on file), and identify the dates of involvement in the study.\u201d \n\nas the fda and regulations are vague on the specifics (they don\u2019t even mention using a training log!), so unless there is a sponsor required training matrix that is also cited in the protocol, pi can technically determine on their own what \u201ctraining\u201d means. if pi wants to say they hosted a meeting before the siv to review the protocol in depth with their team and list that somewhere, great, they certainly can do that. that being said, they are gonna need to make sure the sponsor doesn\u2019t have conflicting sops and requirements or else they\u2019ll never be activated. but some sponsors see no issue with a fully signed doa ahead of the siv for their study.",
                "training does not necessarily mean siv training though nothing in the regulations say you have to attend siv training or even sponsor training in order to be delegated pi can technically do whatever training they see fit fda guidance even lists just pointing to a cv as enough to show a person trained to something you dont need a training log if you can show that someone is effectively able to do a task in the study, per the fda. whether the sponsor is cool with that or not is another thing (and generally sponsors have their own training requirements they want the site to follow). but it\u2019s no violation of any fda regulations or ich if the pi wants to attest that someone is already \u201ctrained\u201d (because maybe the pi trained them on their own) and delegated ahead of the siv.",

                "the point of blinding is to prevent bias in treatment of subjects or in outcomes assessments if its not practically possible to make the two treatments look the same so that it is unavoidable that the staff administering the treatment will know the treatment assignment you need different blinded and unblinded staff for example if the study is comparing patients who were treated with a medical device versus people who did not receive the device theres kind of no way for the person whos setting up the device to be blinded. some protocols will use sham devices but that can be prohibitively expensive and complicated. another example is meds that have to be mixed immediately before administration.\n\nhow the tasks are divided up depends on the specific study procedures and staff capabilities. the important thing is that whoever does the randomization and ip-related tasks can't conduct the blinded assessments.",

                "there are not really explicit guidelines on this afaik my general advice would be that the principles of gcp require us to deliver accurate results from clinical trials regarding the therapeutics under investigation as a result you should generally come to the conclusion that items impacting primarykey secondarysecondary endpoints or key safety data saes aes leading to discontinuation etc.) probably fall into the category of not being consistent with gcp. but the \"how\" that is addressed in this particular situation are likely to be logistically complicated depending on if you're already filed your initial bla, or if you have filed but are now doing a new data cut to submit as a major amendment, etc.\n\nnonetheless this is not your call alone. this is a decision that needs to be made in conjunction with data management, pharmacovigilance, stat programming, medical, stats, clinical, and honestly probably the c-suite if it's a \"small\" company as you say.  if that's not already the sop at your company, then it should be and whoever wrote the sop doesn't know what they are doing.\n\nsince this is an interim dataset, the logistics of unlocking/relocking can be very, very messy. for example, if you re-pull the ae database after unlocking to update this datapoint, it can be difficult to guarantee that nothing else was changed in the database by the sites (e.g. the site added another ae later which technically would have occurred during the intended analysis period).\n\n(the exact logistics depend a bit on how dm locked down the exact forms. sometimes dm can unlock just a single form, but not always )\n\nat the very least, the principles you need to follow are that you should expect to explain to an auditor what happened, how the issue was addressed, why you did it that way, that you recognize and documented this was a potential data integrity issue, and to produce documentation which clearly shows how that process was executed. among those things, as you alluded, are performing proc compares of before/after datasets and the corresponding tfls to ensure that the expected changes in the outputs match what was updated in the database. but there are other considerations, e.g. whether all tfls should be rerun to ensure that timestamps are properly aligned, etc.\n\nthe exact logistics need to be carefully coordinated with dm and stats programming, and the cro if you are being supported by a cro for any of those services.\n\nthis is one of the things that your vp of biometrics is employed for and they really should be taking point on this.",
                "this is not unusual at all in oncology\n\neg initial bla submission would be based on primary endpoint of progression free survival but the study remains ongoing for overall survival followup as confirmatory evidence for full approval\n\nthe level of data cleaning in such a scenario would be at the same level as a regular database lock (more than likely 100% sdv, all queries resolved, etc.) because it's being used in support of a regulatory submission. no sponsor in their right mind is going to submit data in support of bla approval that has not been cleaned to that degree.",
                "anything more i would need to charge my consulting rate  \n\n  \nthe best advice i have for inspection is if its not documented then it didnt happen the real concern most likely isnt whether a single data point will impact the approvability of your bla- that would be extraordinarily unusual and, to be honest, if one single data point can swing it your drug is probably not very good anyway. the main risk is losing credibility in the submission process and inspection findings.\n\nif the bla is already submitted, i would definitely be having conversations with regulatory team about what our options are. if it hasn't gone out the door yet, your options are probably either (i) unlock the form and re-pull the database, rerun entire sdtm/adam/tfl package and re-qc to ensure the only change is the one you expect or (ii) leave the database as it is, but document the change in the csr. \n\n again, the biggest risk is most likely the perception that the company doesn't know what they're doing ( not a great sign that there was a data issue in topline reporting for a pivotal study) and that you didn't properly have oversight of your cro or weren't following your established processes. documenting the issue and rerunning the tfl package to correct is the most transparent imo. if the logistics of that are impossible with a live database, then document why it was felt to be impossible and how you mitigated it. \n\nbut the final call here is above your pay grade. this is why your head of stats/stat programming is employed.",
                "biostatistician ie study designer here \n\ngenerally speaking studies fall into  buckets dose finding/safety, proof of concept, and pivotal/registrational. \n\nfor the former two, i would say that modifications to study design generally don't matter, so long as they support the goal of answering the question of \"what is the mtd/optimal dose of the treatment\" or \"does the treatment work in one or any patient populations\". protocol amendments are a pain in the tushy, so nobody is going to bother amending a protocol that doesn't help accomplish one of those things. \n\npivotal/registrational studies are more complicated. the ideal answer is always \"don't modify the study design\", because essentially any time you do once it's initiated, the integrity of the study can potentially be called into question. that said, shit happens. studies take a very long time and are very expensive. often we are trying to power a phase 3 study for overall survival when we had only very limited data in phase 2, or for example only mature progression free survival data without mature os data. a new therapy which changes the standard of care in our comparator arm may have gotten approved. a competitor might have come out with new data that would suggest the bar we were aiming for would not be competitive. there's lots and lots and lots of things that can go wrong there where modifying the existing study design, generally in blinded fashion with oversight from data monitoring committees, is a better move than trudging ahead for several years and several hundred million dollars with an old design that doesn't quite make sense. \n\nso, generally, in pivotal/registrational studies such modifications can work ok as long as the study is still blinded and it's relatively early on in enrollment. if you are very late in enrollment and/or the study is already unblinded, you are probably kinda up the creek.",

                "i didnt say otherwise \n\ncros will still need a sponsorfacing dm lead thats based where the sponsor is often north america but nonna sponsors also are biased towards their own localities too. it's just a fact. anyone that would say otherwise has not sat through enough bid defenses to recognize it. \n\nthere is a lot of support staff underneath the dm lead and that, perhaps, can be done without compromising quality. but from a business development perspective (i.e. sponsors awarding contracts) it's not only quality that matters, but the *perception* of quality that also matters. cros moving the majority of their operations elsewhere will risk the perception that the quality is not there, regardless of whether that's legitimate or not."

                "im right with you on the deviations we have one right now where its a safety deviation if the pi doesnt log in and sign off in  hours of edc entry of sae --- and every change to the sae entry. the pi still has to do the paper log and sign there, but submitting the paper is not enough for this sponsor. they require the pi sign into the edc and verify that the crc entered everything correctly. it's maddening trying to chase down these pis!  we have two sites and normally when there is an sae, they are never in the same office as me.\non top of that, if the sae has to be reported to safety, a \"dynamic\" form shows up in the edc. we asked for the questions in a format similar to the edc guide and were told they don't have anything like that because the form is dynamic and changes based on your response to a question. we literally had to make our own source by waiting for an event, then pushing every button and recording the q/as. they wanted the pi to sit there with the source binder, patient chart, and hospital records all at once and answer these questions? do they know what a surgeon does in real life? the next craziest part is that our crcs can answer like 90% of the questions without overstepping their bounds and making a clinical decision. \n\nthey are literally our only sponsor like this and i just got an email that they met enrollment goals. i have never been happier to see a study take the next step to moving on before we got too many participants enrolled!",
                "we have several ways to combat the prescreen obsessed people not always effective but it has helped \n if you have your information in a database where you can pull reports amend your sop to be qweeks.then when you say it's your sop to do pre-screen reports every 2 weeks, it's true.\n2. if they push back, you can then negotiate time or money. if they want them weekly, you say our fee for that is xx, whatever amounts to having the crc work an extra hour or so on that protocol. if money isn't enough, negotiate time. you can say okay i will send the report weekly, but only have a recruiting update call monthly to balance the time spent.\n3. this one is easier if you have a lot of screeners reviewing patient charts in clinic or in hopsitals. overwhelm them. send in hundreds of prescreens a month and explain that a lot of people qualify but you cannot reach them all due to being only one person. i have had a couple sponsors tell me to stop sending them \ud83d\ude00\n4. leverage your budget. once we were budgeted to pre-screen 50 patients and then enter them into an external database. once we hit 50, i offered to renew our original rate for another 50 via a budget amendment. until the amendment was made, no more patients entered. we just received word on that trial that enrollment is closed and we never received an amendment!\n5. budget suggestion #2... explain your fees for spending time with monitors. our line items include on-site, remote with redaction of source, remote without redaction of source, monitor calls up to 30 min once a month. explain to the sponsor that twice weekly contact with the recruiters was not budgeted into your time, like the monitoring was, and offer to add a line item for recruitment calls. for every single monitor contact in your budget, require they send a recap via email so that you can submit it with an invoice for your time. sometimes this is enough to get the recruitment people to back off. if you are always answering emails, generating reports, talking to sponsors, when can you enroll?\n6. play 'hardball', especially effective when you are enrolling at a pace that matches your contracted amount of patients. just don't answer the email/call. then when you come back, apologize for the delay, offer  an excuse (you were enrolling/doing xyz for their trial), and give them what they want on your timeline. last i checked there were no deviations for not talking to a recruitment associate. the worst that could happen is that they 'tell on you'. i always recommend having your management/pi on board with these ideas prior to implementation.\nrealizing that you do not have to do everything the sponsor asks for every study has transformed my view of site based research. the site is like its own business. that means the site (generally) owns their data, develops their own sops, and negotiates their own budget. responding to every crazy request a monitor has asked of me used to drive me nuts. now i ask them to show me where it is required ( like a monitoring plan from the sponsor) or i push back in my own ways.\ni hope this helps. the monitor and the recruiter being two separate people has doubled our sponsor time. can you tell its a pet peeve of mine?!?!?!"

                "are you referring the rampant outsourcing of clinical data management roles i am a clinical data manager who has done some coursework in data science but does not currently work as a data scientist\n\nclinical data management in clinical research is a functional area that is quite specific to clinical trials and distinct from what is called data science outside the pharmaceuticalclinical trial space though there is some interaction between cdm and data science groups within companies confusingly some companies have branded their cdm groups things like clinical data sciences but they are still different. \n\ni can't speak specifically for data science roles with regards to outsourcing, but in general the trend seems to be if there is a way to outsource a role, companies are more and more willing to do so. also in general, remote work is very common in clinical research organizations and i believe somewhat common on the pharma side.",
                "for cdm there are just not many lowerlevel roles out there due to outsourcing and the job market overall and it doesnt sound like you have the lead experience that most employers look for have you tried universities they pay less but may not be as stringent on experience requirements",
                "the dm lead role is actually not a great role for a strong introvert who doesnt like confrontation  there is a lot of project management and interaction with the sponsor if you are cro side and interaction with internal team members  based on the company the workload and time spent in meetings can approach the levels required of a ctm or clinical pm\n\nit sounds like you are thinking of something more on the lines of clinical data associate or coordinator role or perhaps clinical programmer  assuming you are in the us or other high cost locale i would not recommend  these roles unless you were working towards being a dm lead due to the constant threat of outsourcing - even if you could even find an open position as they are quite scarce.",
                "in the us there are many cdms who dont want to be leads who are competing for the few cda roles out there some of these people have  years of experience so that may be another reason why you are not getting traction even on the entry level roles you applying to",
                "you arent finding clintrial and oracle clinical job because paper studies are nearly extinct these days  i dont know veeva and openclinica but medidata does provide training in rave study build that you can pay for yourself but it is quite expensive and i wouldnt bother as it wont be enough to make you competitive for clinical programming roles if you dont have other programming skills like sas or object oriented programming.  if you go in a lead or support data manager, your company will provide the training you need on the edc system they use.\n\nif you are not aware there has been massive outsourcing of low and mid level dm and programming roles, and even some higher level roles, from high cost regions like the us and uk to low regions like india and latam during your time away.   i am us based and i am not familiar with the particulars of uk industry and job market, but on this side of the pond lower level dm roles are hard to find, and the market for lead dms is not very good right now either. so don't be surprised if you have to search for a while.",
                "the medidata rave system or any other edc system like veeva has absolutely nothing to do with the query text  that is completely under the control of the data managers writing the queries or programmers creating the edit check text  certainly many else clarify queries have been issued in systems other than rave",

                "cros have been outsourcing dm to low cost regions for over  years it is an established way of doing business and cros would not continue doing it unless significant number of sponsors accepted it",
                "yes a quick call seems like great idea to resolve an issue in the immediate moment but what happens when dm is now having to do the same thing for  sites  100, 300 sites?  it would quickly become overwhelming.  unlikely a sponsor would approve the budget to cover those extra hours! i have always been happy to work directly with cras so that they can walk the sites through the queries themselves - better the guidance come from someone the crc already knows.\n\nalso, once you establish a relationship, sites will call dm. in order to be effective, data reviewers need to be heads down and task focused. dealing with constant phone calls will prevent them for doing that. the lead dm is already in meetings all day and won't have time for talking to the sites.\n\ni tell my teams no more than two re-queries before you reach out to the cra, and if they think the issue warrants it they don't have to re-query at all before reaching out to the cra. it is helpful if the data reviewers can dialogue directly with the cras and not have to go through the lead dm and the clinical lead, but that may not work on larger or global studies."

                "dont sweat it too much  these things are common and the manager should be used to it  just be straight forward and let them know directly youve enjoyed your time and the opportunity to learn but have decided to take another role that is in line with your plans for growth upward movement new responsibilitiestasks etc.  you don't even have to give that much info if you want.  you don't have to even tell them where you are going if you don't want to.  just let them know what your last day will be and provide it in writing after the mtg.  and i would also spend a little time discussing a transition plan and what all you need to wrap up and pass along before your end date.  congrats on the new gig!",
                "while i have often had to handhold pis to get various tasks handled in a timely manner  never would i suggest someone complete training for someone else and certainly do not acknowledge receipt of materials either  back in the day did i have to sit with a giant citi binder and help answer questions while the pi was logged in to make it go faster  absolutely  but id draw the line there and push back that this is not typical  definitely not the regular state of affairs.  if it were ever found out - you'd have a major violation for lack of pi oversight on your hands and you, personally, could get thrown under the bus for it.  i've seen pis protected over crcs plenty.",
                "recruitment can come from about a million avenues  but the gist of it works the same  sometimes we would partner with pcps community hospitals etc to have alerts sent to us when possible patients were identified  sometimes the patient would reach out after engaging with some type of recruitment materials and would have no prior relationship  but all medical history labs diagnoses, etc would be confirmed as part of the protocol - whether that is chart review or by administering new exams, labs, etc.  research-only centers also typically have a patient database they can use to reach out to previous participants, participants who were excluded from other trials, or who just have a general interest in whatever type of research is being conducted.",
                "ive seen it a few ways  it could be part of prescreening activities or after consenting its part of eligibility confirmationor a bit of both.  but usually we used a med records release form the patient would sign that would allow the med recs to be shared from their provider.  depending on what exactly has to be confirmed, i've seen it be allowed for patients to bring records in themselves.  like copies of labs, scans, prescriptions showing a med they are on, etc.  sometimes though that can only be used to determine someone is eligible \"enough\" to consent and then the records have to be verified.",
                "im used to patient binders at the site having this information  it is one of the only places where a patients identity is linked to their subject  so it would have to be safeguarded as per your sop and regulations  usually this means it is only accessible by the staff who have the authority to view it stays double locked up and out of site otherwise.  ive seen some sites redact certain info - but its as per their site policies/sops."

                "like all things in clinical research this feeling is cyclical ive been a wfh cra since  i was an in-office cra from 2008-2010. some years things are good and some years you\u2019re drowning. this directly relates to boom and bust cycles in hiring. \n\nmost people, myself included, were doing fine in 2021 and 2022, started to notice losing work-life balance in 2023 and are now completely drowning (hence the lack of my youtube videos). this is exactly what happened in 2007 with a hiring boom, 2008 people started to notice losing work-life balance and in 2009 they were drowning. though i wasn\u2019t in clinical research then i\u2019m told the same cycle happened between 1999 to 2001. \n\nproblem is the completely drowning phase is also when there aren\u2019t many jobs so people get stuck and can\u2019t quit and companies are aware of this. productivity is maintained by less people working more and companies can cut headcount and cost. ultimately, though, quality of work declines and people become unhappy and new hiring is forced. \n\ni don\u2019t think it\u2019s wfh versus in-office that matters much (unless you have some awful commute). it\u2019s adequate resourcing versus significantly inadequate resourcing that makes the greatest impact. this is my takeaway from about two decades of working in clinical research.",
                "sorry to hear that the mass layoffs arent over i expect to see hiring pick up in  there are going to be lots of layoffs in 2024, 2025 will somewhat stabilize and more substantial hiring will occur again in 2026. similar after the bust in 2009, hiring picked up in 2011.",
                "while salaries vary country to country many european cras are paid significantly less than those in north america however anyone that has worked in both regions knows quality of life is infinitely better in europe while you can make more money in the us there are pros and cons depending on what you want\n\ni do feel european cras are somewhat underpaid but also tend to have a much better worklife balance. it used to be standard when i started in the u.s. to get 10 days of paid vacation a year. you were lucky if you got 15 and anything more was unheard of. many places went to unlimited pto which aggravated the problem with people even being scared to take days 10-15 days off a year. in europe, 30-40 days is not uncommon. then there\u2019s health insurance in one versus the other. and, so much more. however, in terms of raw dollars made, you\u2019ll be better off in the u.s.\n\nthat\u2019s why many people, including me, work in the u.s. for the money but will retire in europe for quality of life and healthcare. off topic, but i wanted to clarify the people are talking about european cra salaries.",

                "being a crc is a difficult job that academia doesnt really prepare you well for honestly you could probably take a person with no medical academic experience whatsoever but who has been working an office management job for years and theyd adapt more quickly to the crc role than someone with a background in medical academia the crc learning curve is steep, and you (and every other new crc) are going to fuck up a lot before you really get it down. don't beat yourself up, recognize and learn from your mistakes, and don't be afraid to ask for help from your more senior colleagues. soon enough, you'll have your ducks in a row and you'll be the one who the junior crcs are coming to with their questions.",
                "know who to go to for help on whichever topicarea\u00a0\n\nthis is hugely important ive been in the clinical research industry for  years now and one of the few things ive noticed that's applicable to every single company i've ever worked for is that there is almost never a clear and intuitive delineation of responsibilities, there's so often a huge overlap between positional responsibilities that you'll find that people who fill one role on one study have a significantly different scope of responsibilities than someone with the same role on another study, even if the sponsor is the same. make notes about the responsibility and contact tree for each study you're working on (onenote is really good for this) and refer it it frequently. if you're a cra, your sites are probably going to assume that you're the point of contact for literally all questions, and since that's probably not accurate, having a quick reference guide for whom to redirect questions to is a huge time saver, and will make both site staff and your study team think you're really on the ball.",

                "interesting thanks for sharing when you say upgrade validation is the upgrade being done internally by your company \n\nor is it the typical scenario with most software where you log in one morning and see a pop up saying version has been updated see release notes here\u201d? or something lol (where the customer has no control over the upgrade releases).\n\napologies, i\u2019m just not familiar with oncore haha. do you like it?",
                "thank you for that respectfully that isnt really answering what i wanted others to share i want to hear from other sites that use these tools what collection of documents do they produce when the auditor says please show me your ctms validation \n\ni think its awesome that you guys provide that at the time of implementation and our team really appreciates it; but it doesn\u2019t cover the bit i\u2019m asking about which is more concerning \u201cwhat additional documentation/validations are other sites regularly creating, and responsible for providing when asked\u201d. \n\nthe fda guidelines are pretty fuzzy imo, and i\u2019m trying to figure out how other clinical/site staff have chosen to interpret their obligation (in addition to what the vendor provides). basically, is everyone else regularly validating every feature when an update is released? keeping that documentation on hand? every new major platform upgrade? (this is why i\u2019m asking, because it would be additional work for the site to be responsible for doing\u2014 not just covered by a 1 time courtesy validation at time of implementation).",
                "the breakdown of the specific guideline text and what im trying to pin down because im confused lol",
                "oh wow thats actually really intriguing the part where youre able to test months in advance i think thats a big part of why the other method seems weird to me. our company/sites, we have no control over when a release occurs. sure, plenty of software vendors love to tease upcoming new features\u2026 sometimes we see them, sometimes it takes longer. but for the actual version upgrade, we have no way to test it ahead of time and know how it\u2019s going to work. it\u2019s just \u201chey we changed stuff overnight and ta-da, it\u2019s been upgraded!\u201d haha. \n\nlike to me, it feels like the equivalent of getting a newly approved icf on the morning of a scheduled visit. like, not ideal. i have to consent with the right version so i have to scramble to figure out the changes before walking into the patient room.\n\nfor sites that are using a crio/realtime validation script they provide to internally validate the change, i\u2019m wondering how they avoid staff using the updated version of the platform while someone is performing the validation\u2026 like, we had no control over the day it was released. if validating the change is so necessary for quality, wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to try and say \u201cno one use crio/realtime this morning; we just got an upgrade and we need to validate it first\u201d <- that\u2019s obviously super impractical for a research site lol like i don\u2019t think the business can afford to halt operations. but if the alternative is to let people use it still while internally validating the release like\u2026 it feels like a moot point? your users are \u201cvalidating\u201d it at the same time, by actively using it in their visits lol. \n\ni realize i\u2019m way over thinking this but gosh it just feels like adding a lot of busy work to a platform entirely outside of our control. busy work that isn\u2019t really going to change anything. busy work that the vendor had already done prior to the release.\n\ni hope more people share what they do! thank you for mentioning oncore, i\u2019m going to look it up! really interesting you get to test ahead of time :)"

                "thanks what you just said definitely makes sense to me per the sop of the company i work for this need to be approved by clinical operation medical and bios all together a meeting will be held next week or so to discuss this we are gathering information as to what would be the industrial standard and what are the principles that we should lay down for similar problems in the future \n\na somewhat offtopic but related issue since you mentioned special char is that we are planning a bla but there are special characters on free text or lab unit (for local authority, these were not a problem). i am doubting whether we should change it by unlocking the database or just hardcode it. any recommendations? (unfortunately, this is not explicitly mentioned in the company's sop)",
                "wow your answer was incredibly clear and detailed thank you for taking the time to explain everything so well were planning to create a log to document each individual change instead of repopulatingrepulling the entire database do you think this is a good approach also, based on your suggestions, should we evaluate how these changes will affect our previously submitted tfls for the first ia?",
                "we work closely together with our dm and sp colleagues indeed this is for submission since i have very little experience in dm i was wondering if this whole issue could have been avoided with a better dmp my point is not to criticize the dmp but simply because we now have more experience about what could happen and maybe we can do better next time starting with the dmp",

                "thanks as you astutely stated we definitely worry the most about how much negative impression this would cause fortunately our main results  both efficacy and important safety endpoints such as teae and sae wouldnt be affected as much as i'd love to continue this discussion and learn more from you, i am afraid that i have troubled you for too long and have little budget for your consultancy fee :p.",
                "sorry for sounding like i am blaming someone for the issue that was not my intention at all i am just trying to see at which part of the entire process that we can improve i am trying to understand if we improved the rules for data monitoring all this as part of my own responsibility when reviewing dmp would that prevent some of the issues from being detected too late because i have  little dm experience so i dont' know if this will help or not.",
                "do you put the kdl into the definerg and submit together with the whole package then",

                "you guys are building your own databases\n\nyes and theyre a bit unique in a way\n\nthere are basically  types of databases were building:\n\none is the sort of standard cro edc system.\n\nthe other, which i've been put in charge of designing, is a sort of edc system that's divorced from any clinical trial, and just used by the sites for their own purposes (so they can collect and analyze their own data more efficiently).\n\nbut, for both, we want to have a standardized method for communicating to the programming team what the requirements are for a new study, for functional changes, etc.\n\nbasically, just a standardized crf specs template that will work for both worlds.\n\n>i'm hoping to start one of our new studies that way towards the end of the year and i'm super excited. \n\nthat's awesome! bigger projects like this are super exciting!!\n\n>my concern would be first about sops for your build and validation process, and also how you describe it in the dmp.\n\nso... that's where things are a bit interesting... currently, even for the cro side of the business, there basically aren't any sops yet; only within the last year has the company gone from a 6 person team to a 60 person team, so no one has really had much time for documentation and defining processes yet. it's still very much in the \"flying by the seat of your pants\" stage of things. there are currently several people working to improve the documentation and process definitions, but it's still a bit behind.\n\nand for the side i'm working on, that isn't directly connected to any clinical trial, there isn't even a dmp or anything, as we won't really be doing much data management directly; all of the data belongs to and is controlled by the sites, we're just giving them the tools they need to collect, analyze, and share their data, more or less.\n\nwhile we still do need sops and whatnot, it's a bit of a greyer area than most clinical edc systems (even on the cro side, the contracts we have are designed in such a way that puts us in a bit of a regulatory grey area).\n\n>the other thing i'd encourage you to consider with template creation like this is at a small company you have more stakeholders than just other dm & programming\n\nat this particular company, it really is just the dms and programmers that would use the document; upper management is kind of great in that they put full faith in the employees to do what they know is right, so there isn't a lot of micromanaging from other departments or anything.\n\nand the programmers are pretty much all in india (and it's only a team of 6 devs), and their english isn't especially great; we have one go-between person, the cto, so my primary goal with the document is to try to make communication between the american dms and the indian programmers as simple, clear, and consistent as possible.\n\nthat said, based on what you and someone else said, i might scrap the standard variable codebook idea; to me, it seemed like a decent way to reduce redundant work and make any modifications to standard fields a bit more readily apparent.\n\nmy thought was that, for example, if the options for gender are so consistently the same, it can be easy to miss when they're slightly different for a particular study, so if you have a standard that you can reference, then specify when it needs to be modified and exactly what about it needs modification, it might prevent issues of \"oops, i saw gender and assumed it'd be the same as usual, so didn't actually read the full specification for it\".\n\ndoes that make sense?\n\nmaybe there's a better way to avoid that sort of thing, or maybe i'm just over engineering a solution to a problem that isn't as likely as i fear it could be. idk.\n\nthank you for your thoughtful feedback, though!! i really appreciate it!! i'll try talking with my boss about prioritizing sops more; i do agree with you that they *should* come first, but there's also a lot of pressure to deliver the products we've been promising people, so it can be a tough sell to justify any delay in the product for the sake of documentation, ya know?",
                "i suspect that the fairly recent uptick in layoffs throughout the industry over the past year or so has to do with the federal reserve raising interest rates in an attempt to combat inflation supposedly\n\nwith higher interest rates on loans companies are less likely to take out loans to fund things like clinical trials\n\nas a result there basically isnt enough business in the industry to support the same number of workers that it was before (because, of course, executives and shareholders settling for slightly lower short-term profits is never an option).\n\nit sucks; businesses like cros probably suffer the worst, and the soonest, since they rely on what's basically b2b sales for revenue, and aren't necessarily required, in the short term, for their clients to stay afloat. \n\nand the fed announcing today that they still aren't going to cut rates yet will probably result in even more layoffs throughout the industry in the coming months.\n\nif i'm right that the layoffs are primarily just a result of the high interest rates, at least that means that once they're lowered back to normal, companies will likely be rehiring a lot of the people that were laid off, and the job market in the industry will mostly revert back to normal.\n\nwho's to say, though; corporate greed makes any shitty scenario possible.",

                "id say go for it\n\na couple of pieces of advice that ive learned from my partner being an independent contractor that may or may not be relevant to you but might at least be worth exploring\n\n hire an accountant. this is big. they can save you *a lot* of time and money!\n\n2) start an llc for yourself (unless your accountant advises differently). it'll help with taxes and insulate you from potential liability issues. you can often also get better credit cards and loans as an llc than you would otherwise.\n\n3) keep your business and personal expenses as separate as possible. having a business credit card through the llc can help a lot with that. just make sure to *never* out personal expenses on the business card (though, depending on how your llc is setup, you may be able to use the card to pay yourself in the event that your contract expires or is cancelled; talk to your accountant about that).\n\n4) put damn near everything necessary to work on the business cc; whether it's gas to travel to an office, coffee, cost of a co-working space if you work remote and enjoy those, high-speed internet if you work from home a lot, lunch, a laptop, a desk, health insurance, whatever. you can write *a lot* of stuff off on your taxes, to the point that you can often end up paying less in taxes than you would as a regular employee. your accountant should be able to help you figure out everything you can count as a business expense.\n\n5) if you can, try to ensure there's something included in your contract(s) that gives you some type of cushion/severance in the event of it being cancelled early; maybe 1 month's worth of full-time wages if your client elects to cancel the contract early. this can be difficult to negotiate and a bit risky, since a lot of companies have standard contracts they want you to sign, so carefully weigh how important that security is to you vs the risk of them saying \"nevermind, we'll hire someone else\" and not having other potential clients available.\n\n6) if you can, try to ensure that either overtime is included in the contract or you have a hard-cap at 40 hours of work each week. again, though, contract negotiations can be difficult/risky, so weigh the importance of this vs the risk.\n\n7) bill them for *every last second* that you spend working; don't let them talk you into doing *anything* \"off the clock\" or \"as a favor\".\n\n8) always keep in mind that you are *not* an employee; you aren't obligated to do anything that's not outlined in your contract that you don't want to do. if your contract doesn't specify joining daily meetings, for example, they cannot make you join daily meetings.\n\ni hope this is helpful, and i wish you nothing but the best of luck!!!",
                "i forgot to add but in addition to a cc for the llc youll also want a checking andor savings bank account for it and have any payment deposited to those accounts you can then transfer funds from them to yourself talk to your accountant about how you want to do it though because there are some options with regards to how you pay yourself that could yield some additional tax savings)",

                "but the amount of gng isnt that take away here its that egp was lower in the high protein zero carb group which is the concern for keto not the rate of gng but the rate of glucose production who cares if more gng occurred if it didnt lead to more glucose production of course there is going to be more gng on the low carb group because the demand for the body to produce its own glucose is higher the other group isconsuming  carbohydrates the demand for egp is lower.\n\nif anything this just showed that the body controlled the amount of glucose it was producing in the h group instead of uncontrolled gng dumping unneeded glucose into the system just because it had more amino acids.",
                "ive seen that number highly contested though both on reddit and online ive also seen people who claim to be following a strict keto diet for long periods of time who notice their circulating ketone level to drop to  regularly\n\ncouldnt that also happen if the usage exceeds the generation of ketones?\n\nif it really is as simple as dipping temporarily below 0.5 then simply existing, physical activity, prolonged periods of very low carb eating can all \"kick you out of ketosis\" \n\ndo people who eat moderate protein stay in what is considered ketosis 100% of the time or does it fluctuate throughout the day as people use and generate different levels of ketones?\n\ndoes protein intake simply down regulate ketogenesis or does it actually halt it all together to the point where if you continue to eat protein you would just never enter ketosis? if that's true the body would have to generate massive amounts of glucose in order to meet its demand.\n\non the supply versus demand driven argument, if you were too intake high amounts of protein and high amounts of carbohydrates would your body just continue to produce glucose from amino acids regardless of it being able to use them?"

                "im not fond of nonparametric methods but its an interesting study that utilized robust measures its interesting that the standard deviation for length of time on ketogenic diets was 5 months.\n\nthe discussion postulates increased gaba  as a primary mechanism underlying the observed effects but also noted conflicting literature related to increased gaba in ketogenic nutrition.\n\nthe authors also mention the role of cortisol regulation in the observed effect. yes, we know initially cortisol tends to spike, but with continued time in ketosis and fat adaptation, cortisol tends to decrease - i believe hpa axis regulation is probably a key mechanism for the effects of ketogenic nutrition. since salivary and serum cortisol rise acutely in response to stress, it might be interesting to look at other inflammatory cytokines and/or c-reactive protein in individuals on ketogenic plans vs standard american diets.\n\nanecdotally, i have found similar positive alterations in mood, perceived psychological well-being, and perceived stress for the last 5 years eating strict keto with occasional 72-96 hour fasts. i transitioned to carnivore several months ago with occasional 72 hour fat fasts and the positive effect seems to have turned up another notch. good times, for sure.\n\nthanks for posting this study. twas' a good read.",

                "so you may like to know that the receptor sites that lithium latches onto are the same receptor site that magnesium does you may also like to know that magnesium calms people down and front ive seen has a more obvious effect on those struggling with mood dysregulation i think its interesting that  of the population is deficient in magnesium, due to our dietary choices and farming practices that have lowered the nutrients in the soil (food had much higher nutrition rates 50 years ago). i think you may also like to know that methylated b-9/folic acid is now being prescribed by some psychiatrists. many of my ptsd, adhd, and \u201cmoody\u201d friends get significant benefits from methylated b-9, especially if they are taking 100-200% (its water-soluble, so as long as you don\u2019t exceed like 5-10x\u2019s the rdi amount, you should be good, you\u2019ll just pee it out). they also get significant benefits from magnesium. magnesium glycinate is great because it gets inside the cells better, the glycinate helps transport it. that form of magnesium is also absorbed better,  less irritating to the stomach, and great for sleep. my son\u2019s psychiatrist prescribed methylated b-9 and then he was able to get off his psych meds. i can tell just by looking at him if he has skipped more than 2 or 3 days. it\u2019s crazy. no side effects. do be careful to not use more than 350 mg of magnesium for adult women as it\u2019s a mineral and can build up in the body and eventually reach toxic levels, much like lithium. lot bigger range to get to that point though. plus you\u2019d know, your blood pressure would get to dropping, feel woozy, etc.",
                "as far as im aware there isnt im not  sure im understanding you correctly. so i may be a bit redundant. i just meant that you can consume way more magnesium. like a wider range of tolerability before anything bad. unlike lithium. the range of therapeutic is so much more narrow before toxicity as you know. also magnesium is like the third most used mineral or something. so like your body uses it for a ton of things, so i highly doubt it would mess up the lithium. although calcium regulation is related to bipolar or part of the proposed mechanism? and too much salt interferes with lithium (lithium salt). so can\u2019t say as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium are all electrolytes. it might make you need less lithium if you are taking it though. also i think there\u2019s another mineral that is needed to help stabilize calcium channel gates/flow. like help regulates it. boron? potassium? i can\u2019t remember. since you\u2019re going down the biohacking rabbit hole. chris palmer is doing multiple location study on mental illness with a fair percentage of them having bipolar. the results aren\u2019t totally in. however, it seems that about 2/3rds of his patient population experiences no need for drugs or a reduced amount as long as they stay in strict ketosis. the people who own roblox, there son was not able to be functional till he started doing therapeutic keto with his meds. they are giving him at least partial funding or maybe all of it because they feel it\u2019s so important after there son\u2019s incredible improvement when he\u2019s exhausted all the other options and still wasn\u2019t functional. more research is showing mental illness is related to low-level brain inflammation. also insulin surges. so you can have good blood glucose and a good ha1c, but still have insulin surges. keto diet cuts out all but under 20g? of carbs, so no insulin spike and keto cuts inflammation. so it makes sense. clearly there\u2019s a third who have some other thing driving it, but no one has any clue yet."

                "you are truly ridiculous arent you i have just said to you that the liver is pretty huge organ and you still havent taken that into your false equation or even that protein cant fill whole liver with glycogen on a ketogenic diet in almost all circumstances the hormones are the ones that tell the liver to do such things as storage or release, yet you think that they have any idea of what is stored or what is going on in millions of its cells.\n\nsurely on a carbohydrate rich diet your liver is having good amounts of glycogen, not just because of carbohydrates, but also because of big insulin responces that carbs do to us. you are still thinking from that perspective. yet when we eat proteins and fats without carbs, both insulin and glucagon are in place to deal with all the food and keep the blood sugar in normal range at the same time.\n\ninsulin provide glucose and amino-acids to cells, decreasing the sugar lever, that's one point. glucagon tells the cells in the liver it binded to produce glucose, the other cells that got insulin receptor activated can easily take up glucose from it's neighboring cell to store it for later without even leaving of glucose out of the liver. for some unknown reason you think of the liver as a huge cell that can do either this or that. yet it is million cells that can do both metabolic processes at the same time unlike in cases of huge insulenima on a carb-rich diet.\n\nor perhaps you didn't know that cells don't comminicate on psychic level and only do things when their specific receptors are activated by spefic things?",
                "then we are all are supermen im fine with that \n\nconclusioninterpretation*\u00a0high protein diet is accompanied by increased stimulation of glucagon and insulin within the endocrine pancreas, high glycogen turnover and stimulation of gluconeogenesis.\n\n>  \na mixed meal stimulates glucagon secretion, exerts a protein-anabolic effect and temporarily enhanches endogenous glucose production 1-4 h after the meal by 50%...  \n  \nin addition, hepatic glucose production was increased in close association with plasma glucagon which was still stimulated hours after the last protein rich meal.  \n  \ntherefore, people consuming a high-protein diet and activated gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis are shown to have an increased hepatic glucose production, however a reduced overall glucose disposal.\n\ntry to counter that, good luck, biochemist.",

(other testing may be useful such as apo b tests - i don't have experience with those.)\n\ni would suggest you eat hclf diet for a few days and do a fast before testing. i bet you can lower it like i did. my personal goal of all of this was not to have an awkward conversation with my pcp about starting statins - which this was useful for.  labcorp and quest allow you to go get tested without a rx these days...maybe useful to some of you."

                "specification analysis is a pretty modern statistical analysis tool the idea is that when you analyze data you are building a statistical model that you then typically perform a hypothesis test on one assumption of hypothesis tests ie the things that generate a p value that we use to make a decision) is that your model is an accurate-enough representation of the process that generated your data (i.e. how things work in real life), and if it's not then your model is mis-specified or in other words you don't have the right combination of predictor variables to appropriately predict what you want and all your results are wrong.\n\nok, enough about the mechanics of specification analysis, back up a level - why? there's a tongue-in-cheek term called researcher degrees of freedom to explain part of the 'reproducibility crisis' in science. essentially, if you give 100 scientists the exact same data set, they'll come 200 different results and interpretations. this doesn't mean anyone's doing anything wrong or bad, just that there's a lot of options. an important concept in stats is not just what you think the summary statistic is, but how sure you are of that result. for simple truly random data, we know how to estimate that false positive rate just with some math. but with something as complex as human free will we need to do simulations to understand what the true distribution of that curve looks like so that we can estimate the false positive rate, which is essentially what specification analysis is doing. the core question is 'given the entire distribution of options and results, how likely is it that you would get your result just by dumb luck?' \n\nbringing it back to this paper, it answers nothing about whether meat is healthy or not. you explicitly cannot draw a conclusion either way from this analysis because it just doesn't ask that question. instead it says, \"look at all these results - if researchers were making truly unbiased, random choices in their analysis then we would expect to see this distribution of results reported\". if the results reported do not match that distribution, it does not mean anyone is guilty of misconduct, or being bought off, or having an agenda, because there's perfectly logical reasons for those results to be reported. it simply means that maybe someone should take a closer look at what's going on to understand why those choices are being made because right now there's experts who don't understand why some choices are less common even though they're just as reasonable."

                "very normal and likely has nothing to do with the tea as you stop exercising insulin will rise to reduce the release of energy fats glucose",
                "ldl will tend to stay normal when losing weight a rise will come when the fat flux is driven up fat flux meaning theres a lot of movement because of eating fat which need to be stored then moved from fat cells to muscle cells where exercise depleted stores and the cycle repeats\nldl supports this relocation the more you relocate the more support from ldl particles you need",
                "it shows that drugs are effective at hiding problems",
                "ive never come across any recommendations from him although im sure he has some\ni think he came up with the gk or kg index and that is not easy to achieve more ketone than glucose in mmol",
                "thanks but maybe i should have been more clear in the post  im not looking for anything antioxidant related  i know very low carb increases glutathione synthesis which is part of why it reduces the negative effects of ros  \n\ni am looking for a possible performance gain through training adaptation  mainly thinking of the beneficial effect on carnitine synthesis but there could be other things as well\n\nsince there is no research to my knowledge that looked at small dose vitamin c for endurance performance in people following a very low carb diet i'd figure there are hopefully some anecdotes that can share their experience.",
                "that is indeed the case so that is why im looking at low dose  im mainly looking for the effect it can have on carnitine synthesis but certainly dont want to blunt adaptation if it reduces signaling",
                "i realize it is indeed not a common scenario  its a bit problematic that there is no research at all when it comes to high volume endurance on keto in my case im assuming between  and  hours a week. there's no knowledge on what could aid, nothing on deficiencies if you ignore the high carb studies.  it's all self experimentation for now.",
                "as far as ive seen so far the problems occur because the mother is trying not just keto but calorierestricted keto  trying to loose weight on top of lactating which in itself is energy intensive and would normally by itself lead to weight loss is not a good combination",
                "there is no doubt that it is supply driven\n\n\n\n\n\nthe problem with anyone who doesnt care to look into it is they want to stick to their believe of being in ketosis while on a high protein diet  shawn baker himself announced on twitter to lower his protein and increase the fat to be in higher ketosis to fix an inflammatory situation\n\na misconception is that they believe turning protein into glucose would increase their blood glucose level thus no change in blood glucose level means theres no turnover of protein in glucose  as you'll be able to read in the first link and second link, protein is converted to glycogen in the liver.\n\nsomehow these people want to defend the demand driven aspect because they think if it is supply driven then it is somehow a negative thing.  there is nothing negative about it as far as i'm concerned except that some of that expensive meat is a costly way to create glucose.  but that is an artifact of our society, not of our evolution where you only had to pay for protein by hunting for it which was the same for getting the fat.\n\nhow much protein will take you out of ketosis?  that will be very contextual.  how much exercise do you perform that would consume the glycogen?  how much fat do you eat within your meals?  your body mass and composition vs the amount of meat you eat etc.  how much protein synthesis are you able to stimulate?  how devoid of glycogen is your liver currently?\n\nthis will all cause variation in your personal result but there will always be some proportion converted to glycogen, and thus glucose, with every meal.",
                "it is supply driven when you look into the science  see my comment\n\n\n\nevery meal that contains protein will trigger insulin and glucagon which puts everything at work to store at least some of that protein as glycogen  after the meal the degree to which there is liver glycogen will be the main determinant for the insulin level and that insulin level regulates how much lipolysis is going on and how the enzymes in the liver are expressed to produce either cholesterol or ketones  glucagon also has a role to play in this but is expected to be influenced by the level of insulin when were back to a fasted state\n\nnot eating and performing exercise will reduce the liver glycogen level so insulin will follow by lowering and ketones will rise to protect from protein catabolism",
                "this effect could be explained by an increase in fat uptake by the liver with no changes of catabolism leading to mafld\n\nno the problem is with what mice are fed as kd diet  they are underfed on protein and the protein source casein is very badly converted to carnitine  you might as well poison them and say they dont thrive on the diet\n\nmore details are in the wiki",
                "im not sure what you want to achieve with saturated fat  how does that ameliorate dementia  if it are ketones that you are looking for then try mct oil  mct oil can be added to food in coffee small amounts everywhere and spread out in order not to upset the intestines  mct is all saturated and easy to purchase online.  it is tasteless so it shouldn't influence meals.",
                "fats can only minimally cross the blood brain barrier how do you expect it to do any good for the brain",
                "not literally indeed but since this sub is pretty much a food as medicine channel and even if it wouldnt be starting with saying you have a dementing family member certainly makes it seem as if it has specifically something to do with dementia",
                "so you have no clue yet call my way of looking at things silly and then you go on with an oversimplified logic that would somehow prove your point\n\nwhy dont you ask questions to learn more instead of sticking to an idea based on very limited knowledge",
                "it was a skeptical question given my understanding that the goal was to get the saturated fat content in the brain up to a higher level  also given your knowledge level from your comments ive seen on this sub it surprised me you would try and do such a thing so hence the question  as you can see from the rest of my comment im trying to be helpful but perhaps not successful",
                "you said yourself\n\nour brains contain a lot cholesterol fats are good for the brain im not a scientist so i cant really explain better than that*.\n\nand you point to an article that talks about an association study of which they concluded themselves they have no clue on why it would lead to a benefit.  there may not even be one because it is just association.  there's nothing wrong with asking questions and not knowing but it is problematic if you don't know and don't ask questions.",
                "that is exactly what it says in the title",
                "hmm reads too much like keto xogenius advertisement  hey look we have a scientific study that says something positive about our product  its proven to work",
                "very very interesting  when i wrote my last blog i had to delve deep into the chemistry  it may be obvious for anyone with a chemistry degree but it made me realize how a lot of the reactions are there to handle the excess in hydrogen and how to eliminate hydrogen from the body  our body cant do anything with it although there is some functionality from the resulting water production  in the tca cycle almost each step involves dehydrogenase enzymes to get rid of the hydrogen atoms.\n\ni wonder if there are reverse actions whereby the oxygen atom from water (h2o) is reused.  but in that case what happens to the 2 hydrogen atoms?  absorbed in the bicarbonate buffer?  i don't see any other way to dispose hydrogen than via sweat and urine so ultimately it has to convert back to water."

                "based on the underlying physiology  and a lot of anecdotal data  i dont think keto is necessarily the best approach for athletes when it comes to performance\n\nbut the data against it is painfully poor the biggest problem is that you are taking athletes who are nearly all used to a high carb diet and putting them on a keto diet for a short period of time it should surprise nobody with even a basic understanding of exercise physiology that this will reduce in reduced performance aerobic adaptations are wellestablished to be longterm adaptations - it's not uncommon for base training periods to be months in length. \n\nthe other problems i have is they have a small perspective on what drives sport performance. \n\nin cycling - and some other sports - body weight is very important. most teams use some sort of glucose-depleted training to help with that, which is the same sort of adaptation you get on a low carb diet. it's not a power adaptation, it's a weight adaptation. i don't know if i'm more or less powerful on a low carb diet, but it's really obvious that i climb better at 160 lbs than i do at 180 lbs. \n\nthe other issue is fueling. many endurance athletes who do longer events have significant fueling issues because they are trying to process huge amounts of glucose into their systems to keep their performance up. they bonk, they have the dreaded \"gi issues\", they aren't confident in their approach. driving more energy from fat helps a lot.\n\nthe final issue is pure health. lots of us older athletes - like noakes himself - have ended up pretty insulin resistant following the recommended \"healthy athlete\" diet.",

                "thanks\n\nthere are two big problems with studies like these \n\nfirst they generally only look at weight and therefore they dont account for differences in lean mass if your diet tears down a lot of lean mass then your bmr is obviously going to go down\n\nsecond they aren't looking at insulin resistance and the effect of that on bmr and fuel partitioning. if some of their people are significantly insulin resistant - and that's *probably* true - than that's going to have a big effect.",

                "the therapeutic utilization of ketone bodies kbs induced through ketogenic diets kdshighfat, very low-carbohydrate regimens\u2014has a history spanning over seven decades. this dietary approach has proven beneficial for individuals suffering from intractable epilepsy, parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, and cancer, owing to the significant enhancements in kb levels kds facilitate. ketone bodies, including acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetate, play a crucial role during states of starvation, low insulin signaling, and increased availability of fatty acids, thereby emerging as central to various therapeutic strategies. despite their broad application, kds association with increased health span and life span in mice (1, 2), anti-inflammatory effects on the gut (3), and the ongoing efforts to expand their use, especially in cardiology, recent studies have raised concerns about the potential off-target effects of kbs. notably, preclinical animal model evidence points towards a diametrical impact of kbs on cardiac health (4\u20138), and their fa composition might also be crucial in a preclinical model of psoriasis (9). however, when carefully formulated, kds have been evaluated as safe in children to manage epilepsy concerning cardiac parameters (10, 11). similarly, another human kd study showed favorable outcomes for cardiovascular diseases (12), suggesting that the high ketogenic ratios and the limited variety in fat intake used in rodent preclinical models might not directly translate to human applications and a nuanced perspective is essential. this is in line with a meta-study indicating increased mortality when carbohydrates are replaced with animal-derived fats and proteins (13) underscoring the importance of careful consideration of the kd\u2019s fat composition and duration, balancing the potential benefits against possible long-term health risks. within this research topic, we collected one review article and 4 original research articles to set a starting point for future research topics.\n\n>in the concise review by andersen et al., the authors elucidate the significant impact of dietary interventions, such as fasting and kd, on health, emphasizing the pivotal role of kbs\u2014particularly beta-hydroxybutyrate (bhb)\u2014in the regulation of stem cell biology. beta-hydroxybutyrate is characterized not solely as an energy substrate during periods of fasting or adherence to low-carbohydrate diets but also as a critical signaling molecule that influences key stem cell functions, including quiescence, differentiation, and subsequent tissue regeneration. the review details how the response to kbs varies among different stem cell types, with muscle satellite cells entering a state of pronounced quiescence that limits regeneration, while intestinal stem cells see a delay in differentiation that promotes tissue regeneration due to kb supplementation.\n\n>buchholz et al. present a pioneering phase i/ii randomized clinical trial on the feasibility and efficacy of the modified atkins diet (a less stringent form of kd) in managing mild cognitive impairment and early alzheimer\u2019s disease. their findings suggest that even trace amounts of ketones could enhance memory and vitality, marking a significant stride toward understanding dietary interventions in neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n>dickens et al.\u2019s study on adults with super-refractory status epilepticus undergoing a kd reveals intriguing correlations between increased kb production, alterations in lipid and inflammatory profiles, and clinical outcomes. this study not only adds to the growing body of evidence supporting kd\u2019s benefits beyond epilepsy treatment but also opens new avenues for understanding the diet\u2019s impact on inflammation and lipid metabolism.\n\n>xie et al. delve into the complexities of hyperinsulinemia\u2019s effects on the metabolic switch to kb utilization in proximal renal tubular epithelial cells, offering invaluable insights into potential therapeutic targets for renal protection under energy-deprived conditions. their work highlights the delicate interplay between metabolic pathways in the face of hyperinsulinemia and starvation, pointing to the sirt3/smct1 pathway as a critical regulator of kb absorption and utilization.\n\n>finally, diao et al.\u2019s comprehensive analysis of diabetic kidney disease (dkd) underscores the pivotal role of kb metabolism in the disease\u2019s progression. by identifying novel molecular signatures, their research paves the way for targeted therapeutic strategies that could mitigate dkd\u2019s advancement, offering hope for those grappling with this condition.\n\n>as we conclude this editorial, it is clear that the contributions within this research topic not only illuminate the diverse roles of kb in health and disease but also underscore the burgeoning potential of kds and kb supplementation in therapeutic settings. from regenerative medicine to neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, and beyond, the research topic navigates the complex landscape of kbs, offering fresh perspectives and beckoning further exploration into their therapeutic implications. this research topic serves as a beacon for future research, guiding us toward a more nuanced understanding of kbs and their place in medicine.",
                "abstract\nnitric oxide no produced primarily by nitric oxide synthase nos enzymes is known to influence energy metabolism by stimulating fat uptake and oxidation. the effects of no on de novo lipogenesis, however, are less clear. here we demonstrate that hepatic expression of enos is reduced following prolonged administration of a hypercaloric high-fat diet. this results in marked reduction in the amount of s-nitrosylation of liver proteins including notably acetyl-coa carboxylase (acc), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo lipogenesis. we further show that acc s-nitrosylation markedly increases enzymatic activity. diminished enos expression and acc s-nitrosylation may thus represent a physiological adaptation to caloric excess by constraining lipogenesis. our findings demonstrate that s-nitrosylation of liver proteins is subject to dietary control and suggest that de novo lipogenesis is coupled to dietary and metabolic conditions through acc s-nitrosylation.",
                "abstract\npolyunsaturated fatty acids pufas which cannot be synthesized by animals and must be supplied from the diet have been strongly associated with human health however the mechanisms for their accretion remain poorly understood. here, we show that ldl receptor-related protein 5 (lrp5), but not its homolog lrp6, selectively transports unesterified pufas into a number of cell types. the ldla ligand-binding repeats of lrp5 directly bind to pufas and are required and sufficient for pufa transport. in contrast to the known pufa transporters mfsd2a, cd36 and fatp2, lrp5 transports unesterified pufas via internalization to intracellular compartments including lysosomes, and n-3 pufas depend on this transport mechanism to inhibit mtorc1. this lrp5-mediated pufa transport mechanism suppresses extracellular trap formation in neutrophils and protects mice from myocardial injury during ischemia-reperfusion. thus, this study reveals a biologically important mechanism for unesterified pufa transport to intracellular compartments.",

                "abstract\n\nthe overconsumption of dietary fructose has been proposed as a major culprit for the rise of many metabolic diseases in recent years yet the relationship between a high fructose diet and neurological dysfunction remains to be explored although fructose metabolism mainly takes place in the liver and intestine recent studies have shown that a hyperglycemic condition could induce fructose metabolism in the brain notably, microglia, which are tissue-resident macrophages (m\u03c6s) that confer innate immunity in the brain, also express fructose transporters (glut5) and are capable of utilizing fructose as a carbon fuel. together, these studies suggest the possibility that a high fructose diet can regulate the activation and inflammatory response of microglia by metabolic reprogramming, thereby altering the susceptibility of developing neurological dysfunction. in this review, the recent advances in the understanding of microglia metabolism and how it supports its functions will be summarized. the results from both in vivo and in vitro studies that have investigated the mechanistic link between fructose-induced metabolic reprogramming of microglia and its function will then be reviewed. finally, areas of controversies and their associated implications, as well as directions that warrant future research will be highlighted.",

                "my overall interpretation of the study linked above which is among numerous followup papers indicates that there is a measurable reduction in body metabolism for some individuals accompanied by significant variance in the extent of metabolic adaptation this suggests that the issue is complex and not everyone who loses weight experiences this metabolic change the studys design does not allow for causal analysis and lacks a comparison group, so we can only infer associations.\n\nit appears that for some, the metabolic reduction is significant, while for others it's minor, aligning with what i've observed in related studies. even a 100 kcal/day imbalance can accumulate over time. as in many areas within the nutrition field, these studies reveal extensive individual variability and lack of control over many variables.\n\ni am aware that the study involved an extreme diet and exercise program, and these results may not reflect the outcomes of more moderate lifestyle changes. however, it introduces a note of caution about potential metabolic reductions. i mentioned this study to counter the claims that one doesn't need to worry about a slowing metabolism. the only firm conclusion i can draw is that some people may indeed be affected.\n\nfrom my perspective, a reduced metabolism isn't inherently problematic. an efficient metabolism could even be beneficial, although this particular benefit is not derived from the study but from other literature. it's important to remember that if metabolism does slow, one must adapt their diet and exercise regime to the new metabolic rate, rather than relying on their former metabolic state.",

                "thanks interesting reading with references are always appreciated",
                "agreed it is complex and itdepends\n\nwhat determines what is the demand for glucose    if there is excess protein and that is antiketogenic and hence reduced ketones then the demand for glucose goes up -- so that seems like demand.\n\nas i see it the body can convert excess aminos to glucose or the kidney can filter them out. while the former is inefficient,  it is still way more efficient than pissing the aminos away.   that seems like it would be the case for  either either low/no carb  or carb-heavy, but maybe greater demand in low-carb since there would be less glucose to begin with.      what am i missing, if they don't get converted to glucose (to get converted to fat not used), what happens to them.\n\ni measure regular and agree at 30%  you might be at .3-.5 ketones, as that is what i see at that level.",

                "the findings presented in this review suggest that high fructose consumption may pose significant challenges to brain health by inducing metabolic reprogramming and proinflammatory activation of microglia the ability of fructose to be endogenously produced in the brain under hyperglycemic conditions combined with its potential to promote a shift towards glycolytic metabolism and inflammatory signaling in microglia raises concerns about its longterm effects on neuroinflammation and cognitive function the observed upregulation of fructose metabolism genes ros generation and inflammatory markers in the hippocampus of high fructose diet models highlights the need for further research to elucidate the mechanisms and consequences of fructose-induced microglial dysfunction. addressing these challenges will require a multifaceted approach that considers the complex interplay between diet, metabolism, and immune function in the brain.\n\npotential interventions to mitigate the effects of high fructose consumption on microglial inflammation and brain health:\n\n1. dietary interventions:\n   a. reducing fructose intake\n   b. increasing consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (dha and epa)\n   c. ketogenic diets or exogenous ketone supplementation (e.g., \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate)\n   d. increasing intake of plant-derived polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol, curcumin, flavonoids)\n   e. increasing dietary fiber intake to promote scfa production by gut microbiota\n\n2. lifestyle interventions:\n   a. regular physical exercise\n   b. intermittent fasting\n   c. sleep hygiene and maintaining a healthy circadian rhythm\n\n3. pharmacological interventions:\n   a. anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., minocycline)\n   b. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar) agonists\n   c. melatonin supplementation: studies have shown that melatonin doses ranging from 5-50 mg per day can exert anti-inflammatory effects, with the most commonly studied doses falling within the range of 10-30 mg per day. these doses are higher than those typically used for melatonin's sleep-promoting properties and may be effective in managing fructose-induced neuroinflammation.\n\n4. targeting anti-inflammatory pathways:\n   a. enhancing the effects of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., il-4, il-10, il-13)\n   b. modulating nf-\u03bab and nrf2 signaling pathways:\n      - nf-\u03bab inhibition: application of specific nf-\u03bab inhibitors, such as the peptide sn50 or the small molecule bay 11-7082, to reduce pro-inflammatory gene expression and microglial activation.\n      - nrf2 activation: use of nrf2 activators, like sulforaphane, dimethyl fumarate, or bardoxolone methyl, to enhance the expression of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes, thereby protecting against fructose-induced oxidative stress and inflammation.\n   c. inhibiting nlrp3 inflammasome activation:\n      - small molecule inhibitors: application of specific nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitors, such as mcc950 or the ketone body \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, to block the assembly and activation of the inflammasome complex and reduce il-1\u03b2 and il-18 production.\n      - naturally derived compounds: use of plant-derived compounds, like curcumin, resveratrol, or epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg), which have been shown to inhibit nlrp3 inflammasome activation through various mechanisms.\n\n5. gut microbiota modulation:\n   a. probiotics and prebiotics to promote beneficial gut bacteria and scfa production:\n      - probiotics: supplementation with specific probiotic strains, such as bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, or akkermansia muciniphila, which have been shown to reduce inflammation, improve gut barrier function, and modulate microglial activation.\n      - prebiotics: consumption of prebiotic fibers, like inulin, fructooligosaccharides (fos), or galactooligosaccharides (gos), to selectively stimulate the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria, leading to increased production of scfas (butyrate, propionate, and acetate) that exert anti-inflammatory effects on microglia.\n      - synbiotics: combination of probiotics and prebiotics to synergistically promote a healthy gut microbiome and enhance the production of anti-inflammatory metabolites.\n   b. fecal microbiota transplantation to restore a healthy gut microbiome\n\n6. combination therapies:\n   a. combining dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacological interventions for synergistic effects\n   b. personalized approaches based on individual metabolic and inflammatory profiles\n\nby investigating these potential interventions and their underlying mechanisms, researchers can develop targeted strategies to counteract the detrimental effects of high fructose consumption on microglial function and brain health. a comprehensive approach that addresses the multifaceted nature of fructose-induced neuroinflammation will be essential for developing effective preventive and therapeutic measures. targeting specific anti-inflammatory pathways, such as modulating nf-\u03bab and nrf2 signaling and inhibiting nlrp3 inflammasome activation, as well as modulating the gut microbiota through the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, may provide more focused interventions to counteract the effects of high fructose consumption on microglial inflammation and brain health. additionally, melatonin supplementation at doses ranging from 5-50 mg per day, with the most commonly studied doses falling within the range of 10-30 mg per day, may be an effective pharmacological intervention for managing fructose-induced neuroinflammation.",
                "comprehensive summary and analysis\n\n **historical context and hypothesis formation**\n- **origins of the lipid-heart hypothesis**: ancel keys formulated the lipid-heart hypothesis in the 1950s, asserting that high dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol leads to increased serum cholesterol levels, which in turn, contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and heart disease.\n- **adoption in dietary guidelines**: this hypothesis became a cornerstone of dietary recommendations around the world, shaping public health policies and food guidelines, which emphasized reducing total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intake.\n\n#### **critical examination of the keys equation**\n- **conflation of fat types**: the keys equation, which attempted to predict changes in serum cholesterol based on fat intake, did not distinguish between naturally occurring saturated fats and industrially produced trans fats. this oversight led to guidelines that inaccurately lumped these fats together, failing to address the unique risks posed by trans fats.\n- **impact on public health**: by promoting a high intake of polyunsaturated fats (specifically linoleic acid) and ignoring the diverse roles and sources of saturated fats, dietary guidelines may have inadvertently contributed to other health issues, such as inflammatory diseases and imbalances in omega fatty acid ratios.\n\n#### **reevaluation of dietary cholesterol**\n- **weak correlation with serum cholesterol**: emerging evidence, discussed in the paper, shows that dietary cholesterol has a less significant effect on blood cholesterol levels than previously thought, leading to changes in guidelines that no longer set strict limits on cholesterol intake.\n- **individual differences**: the paper emphasizes that the impact of dietary cholesterol varies widely among individuals, challenging the one-size-fits-all approach to dietary recommendations.\n\n#### **contemporary understanding and recommendations**\n- **need for differentiation**: the paper calls for a reevaluation of the health impacts of different types of fats, advocating for a distinction between harmful trans fats and potentially less harmful saturated fats.\n- **importance of balance**: it highlights the need for dietary guidelines to emphasize a balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids to prevent inflammation and other metabolic issues.\n- **holistic dietary patterns**: rather than isolating single nutrients (like fats or cholesterol), the paper supports guidelines that consider overall dietary patterns and their broader health impacts, encouraging diverse and balanced food intake.\n\n#### **implications for future research and policy**\n- **research directions**: the paper suggests that future research should continue to explore the nuanced effects of various fats on health, including long-term studies that differentiate between fat types and their sources.\n- **policy adjustments**: there is a call for policy makers to update and adjust dietary guidelines based on current scientific evidence, moving away from outdated assumptions about dietary fats and heart disease.\n\n### conclusion\nthe paper provides a thorough critique of historical and current dietary guidelines influenced by the lipid-heart hypothesis. it advocates for a shift towards more evidence-based, nuanced, and individualized dietary recommendations that recognize the complex roles of different fats in health and disease.\n\nthis expanded analysis reflects the depth of the paper's arguments and the significant implications for dietary research and public health policy."

                "med student here for background i used to be pretty heavily keto but going to medical school helped me learn not just how to read evidence based medicine but how to find good quality trials data and papers to help come to a medical judgement\n\nfor those claiming that normal levels of cholesterol are associated with a higher risk of heart attacks  heart disease / death / whatever, i\u2019d highly recommend checking out [this]( video that busts this myth. the u curve association is commonly seen in epidemiological studies and tends to confound real patterns. this allows people to incorrectly view ldl and disease association, making it seem like a \u201cgotcha,\u201d or a win for keto.\n\nthe hard truth is that high ldl has consistently been associated with poorer outcomes in relation to cardiovascular disease and mortality. there have been no long term data studying the vascular safety of ketogenic diets. until real data emerges with proper clinical trials in reputed journals, we need to dispel the myth of keto being the solution to all of humanities ailments, as many here and on r/keto regularly do. we simply don\u2019t know enough to make such a claim. to suggest otherwise is absurd.\n\ncurrent data from the strongest trials conducted over several decades with peer review suggest a lower ldl improves cv morbidity / mortality, and that a mediterranean diet is most healthful.\n\nwhat really saddens me is that people have been studying nutrition science and metabolism their whole lives, have multiple degrees in this, have been awarded several grants and done the highest levels of research work on this stuff in humanity\u2019s history, and their work gets overshadowed by armchair experts or tik tok influencers who believe the work of every major scientist and health organization is flawed. what makes you think you know better?\n\nif you think some big industry paid off big science or big pharma or big whatever, it literally doesn\u2019t matter. i don\u2019t care who\u2019s making money as long as my patients are healthy.\n\nand if you want to prove keto\u2019s efficacy, go run a trial. if new evidence emerges proving keto\u2019s superiority, i\u2019ll happily reconsider my position in light of new evidence.\n\nall this is not to say that keto is 100% bad. most diets have some helpful qualities. keto is great for people trying to lose weight quickly over a short term period, for example. and it is great for epileptics. i\u2019m on this subreddit still because i find some of the science and metabolism intriguing, but i would never recommend it to a patient because it doesn\u2019t have enough data to support its safety.\n\nfollow high quality evidence and data in your health decisions. i always recommend reviewing the most up-to-date dietary [guidelines]( and speaking to professionals (read: not \u201cexperts\u201d, but professionals). it\u2019s always great to have theories and ideas, but we don\u2019t act based on whims and ideas. we act based on data.\n\nmy recommendation regarding your health question is to make an appointment with a physician who researches lipid science at a center of excellence, and they can guide you through the most recent data and evidence and help you make a decision as to what is best for your health.",
                "misleading",
                "its certainly intriguing and promising data but id like to wait for the peer review and the full data to be published before making any claims patients should refer to the current nutritional guidelines to get the most upto-date and evidence-based data on healthy eating.\n\nmods should be careful here about not allowing discussion of patients and their health. this sub is for theoretical discussion of the science, not for informing people how to eat healthy. we don\u2019t have that sort of statistical power yet.",
                "yeah i mean we do the best we can with what we have i was lucky to go to the best center for congenital cardiac surgery to have my heart defect repaired but of course its not possible for everyone but usually if someone is looking for a subsequent opinion on a longstanding issue some of the larger centers of excellence have wait lists people can put their name on for appointments\n\nbut most doctors, assuming they follow the same standards (since they have to be re-certified every several years), will probably give the same advice, regardless of whether they go to a center of excellence. so you\u2019re right\u2014if the op can only go to a local clinic, that is fine too. also it wouldn\u2019t hurt them to get a second opinion locally as well, if they are looking for one.\n\ni\u2019ve actually felt the opposite. it seems clinical guidelines are changing almost daily (for things like infection management and primary prevention strategies for things like cancer), but the training (like the stuff we learn in medical school) feels very static. exams often test outdated practices, and they update rather slowly over the years. all our attendings tell us to just memorize it the way the boards want us to for now, but to realize that management will change once we enter clerkships.\n\nas far as industry influences go, i\u2019m sure they\u2019re everywhere. hard to say who is influencing what (and to what extent)\u2014so we try to follow the data as best we can. there will always be some industry involvement\u2014but i doubt that would change much even if our dietary guidelines reflected different standards. the least physicians can do for now is maintain consistent standards\u2014even if those standards are imperfect.",

                "literally google most studied diet in the world and tell me what comes up the mediterranean diet has several decades of research with some of the largest trials in the world and if youre asking me for citations then ill ask you to do the same. what is your source for your claim that keto is the most studied diet?\n\nthe mediterranean diet does not advocate for a low fat diet. in fact, the evidence is weak that a high fat diet increases the risk of heart disease. what does increase risk of heart disease are saturated fats and trans fats ([source - meta analysis of 60 controlled trials]( the mediterranean diet recommends high fruit and vegetable consumption, fatty fish and olive oil consumption, and whole grains for fiber intake. you could technically do mediterranean diet in ketosis if you wanted to, just by increasing the amounts of fish and olive oil and reducing the amount of whole grains.\n\ni\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201ctheir guidelines force them to.\u201d the guidelines are designed around the research, not the other way around. claiming otherwise is conspiratorial and requires substantial evidence to support it\u2014not just what your hear on tik tok. if you actually read the guidelines and view all the citations, they link to super high quality published data, from some of the largest trials around the world. and if you\u2019ve actually been involved in research, you\u2019d know that institutions keep databases of trial data that report to societal databases, which publish the guidelines. they\u2019re highly evidence based. and suggesting otherwise invalidates the work of decades of the most prolific researchers who have been pioneers in our understanding of longevity and heart disease.\n\nlook, i have no problems with you or whoever doing keto. but let\u2019s not sit here and promote it to the general public as if we know what we\u2019re talking about, because we both know there isn\u2019t enough data to support that. the simple truth is that keto doesn\u2019t have enough rcts over many years to prove it. if one day that changes, then fine. but until then, it\u2019s irresponsible to make unsubstantiated claims.\n\nedit: and to your claim that there are 300 active rcts, did you check how many there are for mediterranean? and even if there are 300 underway\u2014that doesn\u2019t mean that all 300 are published. why not wait till the published data is out before claiming keto\u2019s superiority? try to espouse an evidence-based mindset.",
                "so unlike you i actually took the time to go through everything you linked to\n\non clinicaltrialsgov if you search for ketogenic diet under interventions you get 97 results. if you search for mediterranean diet, you get 478 results. you forgot to mention that, didn\u2019t you? funny how that happens. i will again make the point that regardless of how many trials are ongoing, it doesn\u2019t matter because none of these are published. we make guidelines based on published research, not preliminary data.\n\njust by pure numbers alone, you linked to roughly 30 clinical trials claiming keto superiority. even if they were not cherry picked, ~30 is nowhere near close to the hundreds of trials done on mediterranean.\n\nmost of your linked trials are low carb, not ketogenic. and i personally have no problem with low carb. additionally, certain studies like the one published in atherosclerosis 2016 were actually done with low saturated fat.\n\nas i\u2019ve pointed out elsewhere on this thread, keto is great for short term weight loss, so it\u2019s not surprising that these rcts show short term weight loss. guess what else demonstrably improves every metric of metabolic syndrome? weight loss. so on paper, ketogenic diet seems great.\n\nand yet, not a single rct you linked shows long term data (correct me if i\u2019m wrong). several of your trials quit the rct approach after 1-2 years and went on to report observational data, finding that even though keto group had better numbers in the short term, they had greater mortality in the long term. i take this with a grain of salt, of course, because it is not controlled, but it is still interesting to see.\n\n[here]( is a link to a report that has 20 million person-years of follow up, claiming convincingly that ldl is associated with heart disease. can you find me anything similar to vouch for keto? until you can, i will continue to promote mediterranean.\n\nyou will perhaps claim that it is impossible to do a trial for that long. perhaps you\u2019re right. can you at least find substantial observational data going back several decades that shows less mortality on a high fat diet? i couldn\u2019t find anything.\n\njust because you can lose weight faster with an intervention does not make it superior for overall health. there is importance to doing things safely. let me emphasize this: *there is no long-term evidence to support the safety of ketogenic diets.*\n\ni\u2019m not trying to do a \u201cgotcha\u201d or anything. i\u2019m legitimately serious\u2014if you have substantial data supporting long-term safety of keto or high saturated fat diet, then send it my way.\n\nyour observations about exploding obesity and diabetes etc are correct. it may even be plausible that it is a result of a high carb diet. but i\u2019m not sure how you get from there to \u201cbest way to prevent metabolic syndrome is to have sky high ldl.\u201d is clean eating, sleep, and exercise not enough?\n\nthere are so many things that can cause the obesity pandemic, and y\u2019all chose to focus on carbs. i get it\u2014sugar is awful. but that doesn\u2019t mean that the answer is to consume copious amounts of saturated fat to meet your daily caloric needs. like there has to be a balance somewhere. you can cut out the sugar and eat clean and still reap the long term benefits.\n\nmy final point is that i\u2019m happy to debate the science. but at the end of the day, you should not be promoting health advice to patients that isn\u2019t based on the strongest data for health. i don\u2019t normally comment on this sub (i\u2019m just here to read papers), but i\u2019m taking the time to do so right now because y\u2019all are choosing to misguide a patient. it\u2019s irresponsible.\n\nedit: and btw, examining the short- and long-term evidence is part of what is known as *examining the totality of the evidence.* this is what is done when creating guidelines for diet and health.",
                "nearly all the studies you sent me from the diet doctor list weight loss as the primary and most distinct change in trial participant datawhich i agree with not sure why you think its some obscure fascination of minejust read the trial data lol\n\nbullshit food frequency questionnaire\u201d literally proves you didn\u2019t read what i sent. either that, or you\u2019ve gone so far off the deep end that you believe every organization in the world is secretly collaborating to destroy our health, so it\u2019s not worth reading any studies that disagree with that view.\n\nit\u2019s impossible to have a discussion with you when you aren\u2019t even reading my data. im taking time to read what you\u2019re sending, and you won\u2019t even read what im suggesting.\n\nthe purpose of the pnas article you sent was to confirm that neanderthals were carnivore\u2014it provides zero epidemiological data. by citing the pnas article, you\u2019re making a common logical fallacy in suggesting that our historic diet means that this is exactly what we should be eating. this actually doesn\u2019t make much sense\u2014we\u2019ve also evolved to store fat in our abdomens; does that mean we should keep storing fat there? of course not\u2014fat accumulates around the pancreas and causes pancreatic dysfunction, contributing to dmii, among other things.\n\nwe have evolved imperfectly\u2014we\u2019re not as well-oiled as you think we are (but you would need to go to medical school to understand this). our diets at the time were based on what we could hunt and scavenge. that doesn\u2019t mean they were perfect for us. no single species is perfectly adapted to its environment. humans, as advanced as we are, are still trying to adapt to our environment (antibiotic resistance, for example).\n\nand to whichever article you\u2019re citing about industry involvement\u2014people are going to try to find ways to take monetary advantage of every situation that arises. if the world were to suddenly shift keto, do you not think people would milk that? hell, we\u2019ve already got carnivore influencers selling their own supplements \u2014 there is no freedom from industry influence. \n\nin any case, *i\u2019m still waiting for an article from you showing reduced morbidity / mortality on a long-term ketogenic / high saturated fat diet.* keep it coming, buddy\u2014you\u2019re getting nowhere with this. you\u2019re dancing around the absence of the real data, instead citing evolutionary diets and industry influence. i agree that we evolved as heavy meat eaters. i agree that there is heavy industry influence. i agree that keto has a lot of short term benefits. but before i recommend to patients, i need data ensuring long term safety.\n\nedit: didn\u2019t see the last article you sent until after my comment. but that also doesnt help your argument. so what if no cap was established? the point is to limit saturated fat intake. we might not have the data to know where to set a hard limit, but what we do know is that higher saturated fat intake is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. some people get lung cancer after smoking for only 10 years. others smoke their whole life and don\u2019t get lung cancer. does that mean, since we don\u2019t know where the hard cutoff is for smoking, that we shouldn\u2019t tell people to limit cigarettes? that\u2019s the kind of logic you\u2019re bringing into this",
                "why shouldnt we store fat in our feet and btw we dojust a little of course we need fat during faminethe problem is weve stored it in the wrong area, and that causes disease. again, we\u2019ve evolved imperfectly.\n\nyou don\u2019t need to run an unethical study to prove keto\u2019s superiority. i\u2019m sure there have been people following keto / carnivore for decades. just test them. but i bet you can\u2019t\u2014most of them have probably had a cardiovascular event by now.\n\nedit: and guess what? the reason we have morbidity / mortality data on mediterranean is because people have died following it, so we can log their data and compare it against others. that\u2019s the whole point. so until enough of y\u2019all die off, we can\u2019t make logical assumptions as to whether your diet actually improves risk of mortality. that is why we don\u2019t recommend it to patients.",
                "this shows your poor understanding of physiology both adult and pediatric but again youd need to go to medical school to learn about how hormones affect the location of fat storage and how location has little to no impact on overall lipid circulation if youve looked inside a cadaver you\u2019d understand how fat storage works. and if you understood metabolism and biochemistry, you\u2019d understand that lipids are not used for fast energy\u2014therefore, they don\u2019t *necessarily* need to be stored nearby. (i\u2019m curious now\u2014is this how you talk out of your ass when you\u2019re trying to convince someone about your diet? wow, you are dangerous! like a walking r/confidentlyincorrect)\n\nbut since you continue to claim that humans evolved perfectly, i\u2019ll provide another example for you and any other future readers: sleep position. if you run a google image search on mammals sleeping (try it), you will notice nearly every image shows mammals sleeping on their stomach. contrary to what most people believe, humans would actually benefit greatly if we could sleep on our stomachs. the pericardial sac presses against the pleura, preventing the full extent of lung expansion. flipping around would allow the lungs to expand without resistance. unfortunately, our head and neck anatomy developed in such a way after we became bipedal such that we lost the ability to sleep prone comfortably (most humans will now sleep on their side\u2014going against our evolutionary anatomy). still, lying prone is recommended during respiratory infection to allow for maximal aeration. so i will again repeat: we are evolutionarily imperfect. i can give dozens of more examples of this\u2014we see a lot of it in medicine.\n\nthis is all besides the point. the rapidity of your responses to my comments with linked material (as well as your inaccurate summaries of them, and your immediate dismissal of them) indicates to me that not only are you not reading anything i am sending, but that you simply don\u2019t value a discussion where you can hear opposing views and engage in critical thinking. that is not how science works.\n\nat this point, you\u2019re arguing for the sake of argument. it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019ve attached your whole identity to this diet, and anyone who goes against it is attacking your identity (that actually seems to happen a lot on this sub). there is no ownership or identity required in scientific thought. all science requires is an open mind. like i said, i\u2019ve tried keto\u2014i\u2019ve read all the same papers as you have. i\u2019ve kept an open mind. even in this discussion, i\u2019ve read everything you linked (sometimes more carefully than even you have!). and after examining the totality of the evidence, i\u2019ve chosen a side. and i\u2019m willing to change sides again if the data supports it in the future.\n\nthankfully, my point here was made a couple comments back **when you admitted that there is no data on the long term safety of ketogenic / carnivore / high-fat diets, as you write \u201cthis study does not and will not exist.\u201d** i doubt it will not exist, but right now, it certainly does not exist, as you correctly pointed out!\n\n**thus, since we have no long term data on it, we do not recommend it to patients. case closed.**\n\nif you\u2019re actually willing to have a real scientific debate, then you will send a well-reasoned and articulate reply with facts and pertinent citations. but if you send me a dismissive reply with no factual basis (as i expect you will, but i\u2019d be happy to be proven wrong), i won\u2019t respond from here on out. good talk.\n\nto the op (u/swinging_door): i hope this discussion gave you some good information on both sides of this topic. obviously, the choice is yours on where you choose to go from here. i\u2019m sorry that you are receiving conflicting information on the best course of action. that all said, this sub really shouldn\u2019t influence your health decisions, and i would urge you to visit a physician\u2014your health is too important to be swayed by potentially misinformed voices on the internet (including my own). healthy skepticism is always encouraged, but discussions surrounding health should always be data-driven\u2014not theory-driven. best wishes to you."

                "i was more or less with you until your recommendation that the op make an appointment with a physician who researches lipid science at a center of excellence  you must know that would be so extraordinarily difficult for most americans that it is essentially little more than an aspiration even less helpful than lose weight and exercise'  when i was a postdoc at a medical school that would have been the clear route, but today i find it difficult to get an appointment with a p.a..\n\n other than that, i would mention that the farther one gets from one's early training, the more apparent the heavy inertia of scientific, and especially medical, knowledge becomes.  there are good reasons for that of course with medicine, as we don't really know jack until the completion of clinical trials.  and there the pernicious influence of funding does come in -- as you know trials can be incredibly expensive and thus are more likely to examine the next potential block buster pharmaceutical.  there isn't that much funding for the kinds of trials that essentially have no roi.  and so the online peddlers, trained or not, fill the vacuum.",
                "that sounds frustrating as hell  i didnt realize clinical guidelines were changing quickly though i am glad they are  yeah science is a somewhat different beast  we are vulnerable to spin grant applications with the buzzwords of the day to please funding agencies and though there is pressure to conform to the reigning paradigms held by well established scientists - max planck's 'science advances by one funeral at a time' --  there is an undercurrent,  competitive urge to overthrow those paradigms.   unfortunately the public perception of that, and a rash of fraudulent research coming to light, seems to have brought us to a nadir of public opinion -- something that the medical establishment could ill afford.  it would be like herding cats to try to convince scientists to have a consistent message, and things can get ugly in fields like climate when there is more awareness of the larger political implications of work.    \nwell rambling now.  at any rate, glad to have people like yourself going into medicine after having life experience with the system."

                "well its highly contextual and dependant on a number of variables quite frankly the answer is it depends \n\ncarbs are protein sparing in so much as the if the bodies requirements for glucose are met by carbs the body won't need to convert protein into glucose. \n\nhowever, if you are metabolically healthy and have a low or zero carb diet \"too much\" protein is unlikely to \"kick you out\" of ketosis as your body is not going to convert the excess protein into glucose to the extent glucose isn't required to meet demand. converting protein to glucose is metabolically costly for the body, so it would ideally prefer to take the path of least resistance. \n\nwhat excess protein will do however is lower your ketone levels. this is partly because the \"too much\" protein is converted into a circulating amino acid pool which is available as required for both metabolic uses and glucose production. this will in turn decrease (but not eliminate) the requirements for ketones. \n\ni don't measure my ketones, but if i did right now they would be fairly low, maybe 0.5 mmol/l. if i wanted to get my ketones higher, i would either need to fast for a few days or increase fat and drop protein & carbs way down for quite a while, maybe a week (not sure haven't tried). \n\nthe reason being, i feel better eating 30 - 40% of my calories as protein. so to run down my amino acid pool takes some time, since my body is still processing my last meal, then using the amino acid pool as a savings bank. from my experience with extended fasting, it takes about 48 - 72 hours before my ketones start drifting sharply upwards. they might be: 0 hours 0.5mmol, 24 hours 0.7mmol, 48 hours 1 mmol, 72 hours 1.4 mmol.",

                "what determines what is the demand for glucose    if there is excess protein and that is antiketogenic and hence reduced ketones then the demand for glucose goes up - so that seems like demand.\n\ndemand is demand - i've been in ketosis for 5 - 6 years and i'm pretty much always in ketosis even though my carb intake varies wildly. i speculate that certain metabolic machinery just runs on ketones as a default after a while. \n\nthe red blood cells, some cells in the kidneys, brain & testes will always require glucose. i've seen figures of a minimum required per day of 130g, although i suspect for me it is higher as i'm 194cm. \n\nif i don't eat any protein for a few days, my body will respond by upregulating ketones and fatty acids for fuel, and switch to producing glucose from fat. hgh will rise, preserving bodily protein stores. so my blood ketones will go up. \n\nif i start eating protein again, my body will switch from using fat as fuel to using more protein - both as required to the extent it is available, and as demanded. how much protein i need from day to day will vary depending on multiple metabolic factors. how much is left over, the use my body makes of it will be whatever way is most efficient.",

                "i wouldnt say i had nausea but i did have acid reflux have you tried taking an antacid usually on shot day i take some pepcid if its only happening when youre lying down it definitely sounds like reflux. \nsorry, i shouldn't act like i know about what you're going through. my advice comes from having irritable bowel syndrome and gerd (reflux) for over 20 years. i actually had what's called a ph study done before i started the trial. i was waking up with what felt like vomit in my throat. i'm a side and stomach sleeper. i'm sharing what my doctor told me. when you're lying down, the acid can come back up. the best thing for acid is laying on your left side with extra pillows, or your bed raised a bed. i ordered a wedge pillow off of amazon, and it's really helped when my reflux is bad. i'm against ppis like prilosec because studies have shown that long-term effects can mess with your bones. anyway, the rules for reflux are to avoid spicy foods, don't eat 3 hours before bed, and recline your bed. if your doctor says it's ok, i'd use pepcid. you can get 10 or 20mg. you take it every 12 hours. my study doctor and nurse have told me reflux is a listed (known) side effect. it may be messing with your stomach. if you feel sick all the time, it could just be the medicine. an antacid could help, but you may need to speak to them and explain the nausea. they may be able to give you something for it. i hope you feel better.\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

                "as i get closer to my first injection a few days i keep trying to accept that i am going to get the placebo i feel like expecting to get the placebo will help my mind not think about side effects it sure is annoying to feel like i need to eat when i dont maybe stress triggers that having a family member almost die 2 weeks ago hasn't helped either. in some ways, i'm frustrated that after waiting for a trial & giving so much blood, i could ultimately get saline.\ud83d\ude02 on the other hand, i know i'm helping with scientific research. \ni can't get the app myfitnesspal to pair my steps from samsung health. i also did 1 day of what i ate and it said i ate over 1,470 calories. before, i was eating the normal 2000. maybe i set my goal too high for weight loss, so they're saying to eat even less? \ndue to stomach issues, i can't eat popcorn and most nuts. i can't think of anything calorie free to eat. i don't know what to eat. i'm hoping my appetite will go away, but i'm also realizing it might not.\ni'm sure, like many of you, we want to have success and feel better overall. sadly, some of us will get the placebo. i wish i could get rid of the feeling i need to eat when i don't. i drink water all day & that gets boring. if i'm on the placebo, i don't know what i'll do. i've been to 4 different specialists to try to figure out why i can't lose weight. maybe the frustration of getting the placebo will lower my appetite.\ud83d\ude02\ni have a family member's wedding to go to in may. i truly don't want to go if i'm at my current weight. i'm ashamed. i don't want to be in photos. i cry when i get into my car after seeing myself in a store mirror or reflection. i feel disgusting. does anyone else ever feel like they're in a sort of fat suit? it's hard carrying around excess weight. it doesn't feel like me. having 2 chins & fat just plopped onto my body. i know i'm working myself up to disappointment, but i feel like i should prepare for it. what a wonderful surprise and help it would be if i actually was able to lose some weight. \ni appreciate all of you so much. i need people who understand around me. i hope we all find success even if we do get a placebo. \ud83e\udd0d",
                "oh that will be interesting some people in other trials and in phase  mentioned it took a day or  before they noticed side effects i had joined a facebook group last year where people were talking about wegovy  mounjaro i thought i would eventually get it covered i learned a lot in that group. my only concern with survodutide (i still struggle spelling that right. lol) was that the side effects were at 24% or something at the higher doses. \ni wish there was a way to test a tiny drop & see if we had the placebo or not. the first month wouldn't matter, but if i wasn't losing weight and i wasn't on the placebo, i'd be concerned. did i mention i can't do much other than walking since i have a broken tailbone? \ud83d\ude02 fun times around my home. \ni had a yogurt & a sandwich today and myfitnesspal said it was too many calories.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f i've been trying to familiarize myself with the apps and the study app. there isn't much to do yet though. does anyone know if they ever show you your blood test results if you ask for them? do you know of anyone who was denied the trial after the screening? i wonder what they're looking for in the blood & urine screening besides the obvious.",
                "thank you for the welcome \nim fairly sure ill know if i have the drug or not im very in tune with my body  im on medications for ibs even if there were no side effects, i will be able tell by whether or not my desire to eat has gone away. \nwe joke that after all this & a year of fighting insurance, i'll get the placebo.\ud83d\ude02 \ni've had a lot of stress lately & 1 of my parents just had a few strokes. so my comfort was unknowingly snacking and eating. i would go eat carrots at 1am. my diet is fairly good. i saw a ton of specialists since i couldn't get weight off. i did fasting & phentermine a while back. that was awful. it left me with an elevated heart rate. i always seem to worry about my heart now. i get anxious palpitations now, which i never used to get. i also get them when i get my heart rate up too high. i think my problem has been eating 1 or 2 meals a day. i might need to have small things all throughout the day. \ni really felt fat today. i was uncomfortable with my appearance and just felt like i'm carrying around a fat suit. i hate being this big. even if i do lose 2-4lbs it comes right back.\nregarding the injection, i know how to do it, but i don't know how i'll do the actually pushing in of the needle. (i work with needles.) it's different when it's your own body. i'm curious to see if they'll let us change the location. it's mentioned that the doctor may do that at some point, but maybe this company wants it done specifically in the stomach. from what i read about the phase 2 trial, people had too many side effects at the higher doses. they didn't titrate it slow enough. i'm not sure how long your study is, but mine is 76 weeks. guess i should get to know everyone. lol"

                "i did the first of my  mg injection this past week still havent lost any weight lol hovering around the same  pound range. i\u2019m really working on my eating habits though",
                "nice congrats on the weight loss",
                "pounds so jealous haha congrats",
                "thanks for the encouragement i definitely think i have the drug  my stomach feels full im starting to get acid reflux if i eat too much before bed im just annoyed with myself for not managing to lose any weight and that with the help of a drug lol i started out at 215 lb at screening, have gone up as high as 220.2 lbs since then. this morning i'm at 215.4 lb, so i'm headed back down in the right direction. just frustrated with myself that i haven't managed to lose a single pound in 3 months - with or without the help of a drug. hopefully the higher doses will help, but if i haven't managed to lose any weight the past 3 months, who's to say what will happen when the trial ends??? sorry for venting my frustrations here haha. but hopefully others in this thread understand the struggle too, and that's why we are all here?",
                "im on my th injection mg i\u2019ve been oscillating in the same ~5 pound range since i started the trial. haven\u2019t managed to actually lose any weight\u2026 the first 4 weeks, i thought i had the drug, the next 4 weeks, i\u2019m not so sure. maybe next week when i get up to 1.2 mg i\u2019ll have a better idea",
                "i totally am",
                "i do exactly the same i was told  seconds is a good speed wait  seconds after the plunger is all the way down before pulling out dont twist or bend direction of the needle.\n\ndo you let your syringe warm up to room temp for 15 minutes? that should help with the stinging feeling.",
                "btw fellow sd guy here let me know if you want a walking buddy",
                "hehe yeah lets hope so please remember to stay hydrated too",
                "that sounds fantastic",
                "in case anyones curious and hadnt actually seen the data published last year this is from the phase ii clinical study",
                "yeah its a good question i think its from the first dose\n\ni think for this trial they probably just dosed patients at the final dosage level so no priming period at lower doses like we are going through so for example, participants in the 3.6 mg arm of the study immediately got a 3.6 mg injection on the first day (week 0).\n\nthe common issue with this for all of the glp-1ra agonists is the side effects (nausea, vomiting, bowel distress, etc...), which is the reasoning for the long dose-escalation schedule that we have for the synchronize trials. because they find that priming patients at lower doses and titrating up reduces the incidence of adverse events.",
                "i think the data indicates a higher dose might have a greater effect hence the reason for a  mg dosage arm in the phase  studies and weight change has not plateaued yet meaning there could be even more weight loss over a longer study period.",
                "th injection today i still havent lost any weight in fact im still up a couple pounds compared to when i first started kinda frustrating i just love eating unhealthy food (fried foods and desserts). i went a bit overboard this weekend. i\u2019m really hoping that i\u2019m not on placebo and that i\u2019ll get appetite suppression at the higher doses.",
                "thank you both its nice weve formed sort of a little support group on here its encouraging to know im not totally alone in these struggles hoping we all have a good week this week.",
                "im just reminding myself that it will take  weeks almost  months to get to the full dose where we will truly see the effects of the drug so dont lose hope yet. gotta be patient. i\u2019m focusing on trying to build good habits in the meantime, which will be necessary when we come off the drug anyway",
                "i really think that walking is the best exercise for weight loss you can do more intense exercises but often that makes me hungrier so i end up outeating what i exercised and injuries are no joke i had a lot of injuries last year that set me back i walk around outside but also do go to the gym so i don't have too many suggestions. if you do decide to get a gym membership, i walk on an incline to get my heart rate up, without having to run and therefore put stress on my knees. ellipitcal is also very low impact. but i guess both of those require a gym membership unless you have a machine at home.",
                "thats a great idea just watch out for those downhills bc they can hurt your knees too thats why i prefer walking on an incline treadmill",
                "received my th injection  mg dose this week im happy to say i am definitely not on placebo. the problem i am having is that physically, i feel extremely full, even after what i consider a small meal (~400 calories). but mentally, i am still wanting to eat, if that makes sense. so the only thing preventing me from over eating is knowing the physical pain i will endure, but i\u2019m still thinking about food constantly. i\u2019m hoping at the higher doses, it will also mentally suppress my appetite. let\u2019s see!",
                "oof i know what you mean about the stomach pain if you eat too much congrats on the  lbs though that is amazing you must be the furthest along of everyone in this subreddit. good to know i can kinda get a preview of what i could potentially expect in the future based on your experience. i just started my 0.6 mg injection this week.",
                "at least you lost weight last week i guess ultimately thats what matters if its any encouragement i do think i am getting the drug but ive lost zero weight actually gained a couple pounds the past month lol). so far you\u2019re better off than i am \ud83d\ude05",
                "glad to hear it quiets your mind despite still having to actively be disciplined the evening time is the worst for me too lol",
                "hopefully at the full dose well get appetite suppression the thing ive been getting adjusted to is that if i eat too much at dinner the whole night i dont sleep well bc my stomach hurts almost feels like im about to puke up the food sometimes. not sure if you've experienced the same?",
                "same here about the   and thanks did you feel a major change going from 6 to 1.2?",
                "ohh i see you literally just dosed today got it haha i hope your pain subsides soon note to self avoid mcdonalds or the like on injection day haha that is tough having to fastdrive all day",
                "the doseescalation for synchronize is as follows\n\n  mg for 4 weeks\n* 0.6 mg for 4 weeks\n* 1.2 mg for 4 weeks\n* 2.4 mg for 4 weeks\n* 3.6 mg for 4 weeks (and then maintenance at this dose, if in the 3.6 mg arm)\n* 4.8 mg for 4 weeks\n* 6.0 mg and maintenance at this dose, if in the 6.0 mg arm\n\nif there are severe gi issues, the provider can lower the dose and try to re-escalate.",

                "your box probably indicates the volume of the solution not the dosage we wont know the dosage bc its a double blinded study meaning neither we nor the provider know if we are receiving the active drug or placebo",
                "mine too were all in this together i just got my th injection so the mg dose) today. congrats on losing the weight! unfortunately for me, i keep eating lol maybe with the higher dose, i\u2019ll feel some appetite suppression \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",
                "i think its really hard to say early on im on week  i didnt feel anything for the first  weeks this week i\u2019m starting to feel full for longer. the dose is so low for the first four weeks it\u2019s really hard to tell. i think starting week 5 you might have a better idea. or week 9 even.",
                "week  for me last injection on the lowest dose i still eat a lot but i feel very full after eating especially after dinner if i eat too much at dinner i feel like i have a lump in my stomach all night. tough because the desire to eat is still there lol. so i'm physically full but i'm still craving something yummy. i'm hoping that on a higher dose, the cravings will be diminished.",
                "third injection for me today still cant tell if i have placebo or not no appetite suppression mentally unfortunately lol but i do feel physically fuller for longer but im still constantly thinking about food and wanting to eat something tastier if i just try to eat healthy",
                "hi i just started the trial today well i did screening a few weeks ago first dose today i also couldnt get wegovy through my insurance so here i am.\n\ni really have no clue if i'm on placebo or active drug. i think it will be hard to say early on given the dose escalation schedule. it will be at least several months before getting up to the full dosage (i think they designed it like that to avoid the side effects). hopefully i'm not on placebo ;) but the truth will be in the numbers on the scale and waist measurement haha.",
                "i was shown my blood test results the clinical trial doctor went through my numbers with me and pointed out any abnormal results ie things to watch out for and work on i don't know of anyone who was denied the trial after screening, but i do know someone who was denied for a different trial due to evidence of diabetes at screening.  \n\n\nbtw, i did my 2nd dose yesterday. i still can't tell if i'm on placebo or not. reasons to think i'm on placebo: i still can't control my eating (but i didn't expect any significant changes in the first 4 weeks given the low 0.3 mg dose). reasons to think i'm on survodutide: my resting heart rate when i wake up is usually around 60 bpm. i haven't been wearing my applewatch to sleep, but last night i did out of curiosity. my heart rate only got down to 70 bpm. i believe, on average, people on the drug saw an increase of 8 bpm. but then again, i went to sleep hours after i normally do bc i took a nap late in the day. we will see!",
