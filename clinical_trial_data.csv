Vowst should be able to ramp sales nicely in unmet need. Rebyota is the only other FDA approved option but meaningfully inferior- 150mL enema of donor fecal matter, 70.6% recurrence free @ 8wks vs 3-day oral regimen, 88% recurrence free @ 8wks for Vowst. VE303 is a 14-day course vs Vowst's 3-day course. Efficacy is unlikely to be meaningfully different (possibly worse- 13.8% recurrence for VE303 in Ph2 vs 12.4% for Vowst). Neither docs nor patients will care much about donor derived spores vs defined consortium distinction given Vowst's safety profile. Even if VE303 gets approved, it'll be 4-5yrs minimum before it gets through Ph3, approval and payer review process, when Vowst will be nearing peak sales. Ferring, Finch, Takeda have discontinued dev of their oral candidates for rCDI for good reason (ie Vowst), Vedanta will burn cash and not have much of rCDI market left by approval. Pfizer's C diff vaccine failed. Merck's Zinplava is barely more effective than placebo. FDA is phasing out FMT. Vowst is basically the only credible option for rCDI and will remain so until (maybe) VE303 gets approved, but by then Vedanta will be too late.",wise-oracle

My take: this is just the beginning of a run-up. It’s approved to treat S2 T1D, which is essentially an orphan disease. We haven’t even seen PROTECT read out, which will expand access to every single newly diagnosed stage 3 patient. That’s blockbuster territory. I expect to see gradual increase until top-line results, sometime mid-next year.

T1D is an expensive (read profitable for certain companies) life-long condition. So, the reward for effectively preventing it or delaying onset could be huge. There are GIANT players on the pharma industry who are profiting on the current state of things. You've gotta' believe that they're doing what they can to slow the approval process behind the scenes, which, if I'm right, means we're going to see some really head-scratching regulatory responses and dips.

1) BNH - just DCA in for the eventual approval.

The P3 Trial Results are Due in Q 1, Imminent Binary and Worth  multiple billions. As long as you are holding when the whole ""market"" gets the Announcement, you're golden. 

To your point: Shorts may get to cover a couple few million shares Offered at40. IMO

Binary in that, all Gps needs to show is 12.6 months of OS and it gets the fda green light to treat 10000 aml second remission patients CR2. 
Recall dr’s treating actual phase 3 regal trial patients, have said the control arm OS is only 6 months. Since we know from the regal update, all pulled patient OS is 16 months, that is for control and GPS arms combined is 16, it means GPS arm patient OS is, about 24 months close to the statistically significant phase 2 result.

The CCO published pricing comps at $260k to $515K per patient - This market alone is a $2.6B to $5.15B TAM - Worth 10B to Big Pharma using a Standard 4X price to Sales Ratio.

Again, the p3 results that we are now expecting any day - are worth many billions to Big Pharma.

Re Cash: A few variables outstanding, the Licensee 3D Med Will not Be able to Pay SLS fast enough, the 38m they'll owe + another $25m later in 2024.

Warrant Holders will most likely exercise up to $30M for SLS balance Sheet

And STIFEL the Healthcare Focused  Investment bank has been negotiating partnershihps/new license deals for both GPS Immunotherapy and the 009 CDK9 Inhibitor. 009 Has real market comps SNDx and Kura both worth nearly 2b in mcap, with only p2 menin inhibitor assets.

So what this means is - SLS will be rolling in dough when the P3 results come in.

That said, try to look at things from a broader perspective. First of all, it's great that you are now healthy and able to be back at work. Be proud that you created something that's valuable enough to be noticed by others and that you obviously were exemplary in your transfer of knowledge that others could seamlessly continue your work. That doesn't happen by chance.

When you speak next time with your manager, be enthusiastic and tell them how happy you were to find out that your tools yielded such positive feedback and helped the work continue without hiccups in your absence. Recognize your colleague's work, 3 months is not just a simple case of coverage. 

When you speak with your colleague, thank them and ask them for their feedback on using your tools and if they identified any potential tweaks to further improve them.

You should offer to share your tools with a broader audience and train them on their usage.

In general, A&P was so hard for me because it’s not uniform and not particularly straightforward. Neither is research. Both areas I learned best by putting order to the disorder.

Make lists, make lists of lists. Understand all the abbreviations. Know who to go to for help on whichever topic/area. Map out processes/decision trees. Get comfortable with making it up as you go. About 1 year in is when you might feel a little bit more confident.

1) is the patient safe?
2) is the doctor happy? (i.e. if I’m working under their license, am I doing what they’d want?)
3) is the protocol happy? 

Once you adopt that framework, you learn as you go. If the patient is safe, worry about fixing the deviations etc later. Maybe it’s not the most popular outlook, but it does help me to prioritize when I have no time to think things through",lucky_fin

This is hugely important. I've been in the clinical research industry for 20 years now, and one of the few things I've noticed that's applicable to every single company I've ever worked for is that there is almost never a clear and intuitive delineation of responsibilities, There's so often a huge overlap between positional responsibilities that you'll find that people who fill one role on one study have a significantly different scope of responsibilities than someone with the same role on another study, even if the sponsor is the same. Make notes about the responsibility and contact tree for each study you're working on (OneNote is really good for this) and refer it it frequently. If you're a CRA, your sites are probably going to assume that you're the point of contact for literally all questions, and since that's probably not accurate, having a quick reference guide for whom to redirect questions to is a HUGE time saver, and will make both site staff and your study team think you're really on the ball.",darwinpolice

clinicalresearch,New clinical research site,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1coojjt/new_clinical_research_site/,8,8,"A lot of this depends on therapeutic area. I’ve done everything from stroke studies, where you just need enough staff to be on call overnight, to phase one oncology, where you have 50+ people on any given DOA. At a small site, you’re doing everything—contracts, budgets, regulatory, patient visits, data cleaning, monitoring visits. 

I’m working with a few small sites at the moment and a pattern I’ve noticed is that they don’t know what they don’t know. Things that seem obvious—singing and dating ICFS, signing and dating DOAs, maintaining source, recording test results, timely data entry— are all issues I see regularly. 

So first I’d recommend paying a bit above market rate to ensure you get a few knowledgeable staff members. You probably know a lot, but you definitely don’t know everything. Finding another person or two with a lot of experience will help. 

Focus on quality over quantity. It’s really hard to change ingrained work habits/ culture, so it’s important to start with high standards. Invest in training newer or less experienced staff members.

I also like the recommendation of starting small. You don’t want to bite off more than you can chew and end up with a bad reputation or 483.

The Business Ops/Finance interactions I have had with Ex-US teams have been more challenging.

However, I will say that there are a couple of variables that I believe directly affect the quality of these newly outsourced teams and are not simply just the geography:

1. Companies are laying folks off before or concurrently with the hiring of these outsourced teams.  This gets rid of many resources that could effectively train these new teams, and instead, they get left without proper training.

2. Timezones: A Geography based issue, but also half-due to industry processes.  On the Business Ops side at least, we have deliverable deadlines, and those deliverables require (typically) multiple levels and/or rounds of review.  This means if an Ex-US resource/team is assigned on the deliverables, it could take up to twice as long since issues cannot be resolved throughout the day with active feedback, assuming US reviewers. Additionally, the timezones affect attendance for meetings which causes a lack of alignment at times. Some Ex-US resources work abnormal hours to account for this, but not all. 

3. Management: if an Ex-US team has US management/leadership, then the 2 above issues are amplified

4. Language barrier, as others have stated, but this is becoming less and less of an issue.

5. Intra-Industry Movement - This is more speculation, but I believe it will become an issue over time. One of the biggest benefits of this industry is the fluidity of its workforce, a benefit for both employers and employees.  With outsourcing increasing, this increases competition in the labor force and could make it more difficult to land a job at a competitor since equally qualified, cheaper resources, potentially with less tenure in the industry, can be hired.  Specific to the employers, this could stifle the flow of information, experiences, lessons from failures, new processes, new efficiencies, etc from company to company.

Just my thoughts/observations.  Do I think it’s a death sentence to companies that outsource? No.  However, the consequences of the decision to do so will be felt further down the line, and I do not believe it will be worth the cost-savings being experienced currently.",HRho

Over the next few years the trend spread to the other big CROs. Big Pharma mostly appreciated the cost cutting while mid and small don’t trust the quality, driving *some* biometrics business to the next CRO tier. Quality in India slowly improved over the next decade, but then two things happened: 1. Labor costs in India were rising making the savings not as substantial and 2. Even big pharma started asking for NAm/EU biometrics again. Big CRO slowly started growing their Western biometrics staff again. Now the pendulum is swinging East again. The quality out of India is generally pretty good now BUT the higher attrition rates and timezone differences can and do cause some delays and communication problems. Give it 5 years or so and the pendulum will likely swing West again, but by then, the industry won’t have trained up the staff to meet the need, so people will be harder to find.

To answer your question, in spite of people loving to say it will be a disaster, the truth is it’ll be “meh”.

clinicalresearch,Lawsuit? Do CRCs need personal malpractice insurance? Thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1co8ztl/lawsuit_do_crcs_need_personal_malpractice/,1,10,"No… I’d be interested in the context in which this came up. But you should be performing under your scope of practice (i.e. what you were hired to do) and doing delegated activities that are within that scope. 

For example, a clinical research coordinator that does not have a current registered nurse licensure in the state that they are currently employed and/or working, should not be doing any clinical evaluations that only a nurse is licensed and scoped to do in the state that you were working. A clinical research coordinator could presumably take vital signs with a blood pressure cuff that isn’t manual and a pulse oximeter or it is within their scope to take that information from the chart.

 At the site I previously worked at our hospital made all of the clinical research coordinators become a certified phlebotomist in order to ensure that we were acting within our scope of practice when doing study blood draws because whole we could be delegated on the delegation of authority log to do a blood draw for the study, we may not have had the experience or licensure to do so. Legal found this out one day and had a stroke which lead to us all getting certified

At least at the academic site I work at, they will go to court for you. Though there's a tremendous amount of protection for state employees, so ymmv.

I will say that in research, as long as it's done properly, bad outcomes are an expected possibility.

I actively ignore this “rule” simply because there is nothing in my SOPs that says they can’t. So I encourage my CRAs to access site portals to save trouble. However, I do ask them to write remote site contact reports to document what they do.

Staff at these sites are spread extremely thin so if you don’t hear within a couple of weeks, contact them again as it could have just slipped between the cracks. 

I agree with all of the others’ comments and want to recommend that if there is a research consortium on your disease, I would try to establish care as a clinic patient at one of the consortium sites, ideally the lead site if you can, and enroll as a participant in the research consortium. That’s the best way to get on their radar. That way they already know everything they need to know about you before you are even screened for the trial, and they know you’re interested in being contacted. This makes it easy for them and you’ll also be receiving care from a team that is more specialized, well-connected and on the cutting edge of the science on your condition.

If this is one of the first or only drug/therapy trials for the disease, it may be very competitive enrollment unfortunately. Often the people who were involved with the natural history studies that would have proceeded the drug trial end up filling all of the available slots. I wish this weren’t the case but it’s the reality of clinical research at this time.

1. First, state your name, email and contact phone number.

2. Summary: remove the numbers. Brag about yourself but also talk about what you want to achieve at the new organization. Don’t bold and emphasize your masters degree. 

Proficient at CTMS, EDC and eTMF systems should be in skills not in your summary. Also everyone in clinical research will probably list this on their resume.

3.Education should be at the bottom after work experience and skills should be where the education is. The first line is good enough. Since you also finish and received a degree. Relevant coursework is irrelevant since you completed it. 

4.Bolded text
I suggest putting some of some of them in your skills if your trying to highlight you have experience working on placebo controlled trial, CTMS, EDC, eTMF systems. Including bolded text on the resume can make or break your chances. Your basically giving recruiters to look at summarize bolded test and not read anything else.

clinicalresearch,Remote workers in Clinical Research,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cn3fca/remote_workers_in_clinical_research/,36,23,"Like all things in clinical research, this feeling is cyclical. I’ve been a WFH CRA since 2011. I was an in-office CRA from 2008-2010. Some years things are good and some years you’re drowning. This directly relates to boom and bust cycles in hiring. 

Most people, myself included, were doing fine in 2021 and 2022, started to notice losing work-life balance in 2023 and are now completely drowning (hence the lack of my YouTube videos). This is exactly what happened in 2007 with a hiring boom, 2008 people started to notice losing work-life balance and in 2009 they were drowning. Though I wasn’t in clinical research then I’m told the same cycle happened between 1999 to 2001. 

Problem is the completely drowning phase is also when there aren’t many jobs so people get stuck and can’t quit and companies are aware of this. Productivity is maintained by less people working more and companies can cut headcount and cost. Ultimately, though, quality of work declines and people become unhappy and new hiring is forced. 

I don’t think it’s WFH versus in-office that matters much (unless you have some awful commute). It’s adequate resourcing versus significantly inadequate resourcing that makes the greatest impact. This is my takeaway from about two decades of working in clinical research.",clinicalresearchguy

I was fully remote from like April 2020 until the beginning of 2023 when I changed jobs, and by then I was ready to get out of the house. Something weird happened though when my previous job started allowing us back in the office around I think early 2022 - I didn't want to do it, I wanted to just start fresh going in somewhere else. Only reason I can think of for this is that they (my previous place) stopped using about half of our office space which is where my office was (nearly all of us had individual offices w/doors and most had windows) and I didn't want to go through booking a shared space on the unfamiliar floor etc. after that long of not going there.

Now, because I can walk to work, it's not as stressful as driving and the walk to/from is a nice way to transition in and out of work mode, and leave it all there. I have flexibility for 2 days remote/week and sometimes I do none, often I'll do 1 and sometimes I do 2. This is a pretty good situation but if I were to move and have to drive in, I'd probably take both remote days.

Thirty years ago when I graduated college, it sucked for me, my wife and my friends who had just a four year degree unless we were moving on to professional school (law, med, engineering, etc). We either bounced around horrid jobs in manufacturing, service industry, or call center, or (if we were lucky) management consulting/accounting  jobs at a  "" big 4"". KPMG literally sent emails saying that 50 billable hours per week minimum were expected during busy season, which translated to 70 hour work weeks for months.

I do empathize because I know that it sucks even more now with housing/inflation and the economy in general, however I think it's important to set expectations if you have a four year degree with no specific professional training. Most jobs that are available that pay well with benefits and a somewhat regular white collar schedule are going to be difficult and demanding. You could work for a non profit, get into public service, be a ski instructor or whatever but you would need to sacrifice pay & benefits.",verypersistentgapper

When I started at Syneos, I had an **amazing** LM and CTM. When the new line manager was assigned, the first thing (and I mean the VERY first thing she said to me) was “you should be on a PIP”. 

At the time, RESOURCING had only allocated me to one study and that study was in Close out. I closed over 40 sites and added 10,000 docs to TMF. I did not have DOS because the sites were all closing. However, I was also the only CRA on the study. This same LM would not allow me to do any agile monitoring. So? 

This is the culture of Syneos. They allow this. I went to HR and my LM COM. I was told to “calm down” and stop complaining. 

I’m glad you’ve had good teams. You’ve been lucky. I wasn’t. Syneos has a massive disconnect between what Execs are asking for and implementation at the CRA level.

It's about how you present your goals and skill sets. My first sponsor role was an entry level CTA one where the only requirements were to take directions well and be organized. I got my first big break as a sponsor CRA. 

Working for a CRO is rigid, its structured and your roles are defined. You have metrics and what matters during interviews are the cold hard numbers you can present - DOS, # visits, # indications. They care about your performance in your role and how easy it is for you to jump right in. That's the only way you're billable.

Sponsors don't care about the metrics or how well you perform in your set role. They care about how much you're willing to work cross functionally and how you can redefine your role. They care about the teamwork and success of the pipeline and company and just not the clinical trial you're running. If you pigeonhole yourself into your role, you'll struggle.

In academia, we cultured unique voices to speak up and be heard as students, only to put them in a vice when they graduate that their jobs are constantly on the chopping block from budget guts or missed grant funding. I also hated how mediocrity was celebrated - so many people only cared about publishing for their resumes or to get their name mentioned on regional calls.

I just really like infectious diseases and thought it would be cool to learn more.

I’d like to be a director one day, so I think my degrees might help some, but definitely wouldn’t have gone back just for that. Advanced degrees are simply not that impactful in CR unless it’s an MD/PhD/PharmD and you’re going more of the medical director route.",honey-smile

Cutting corner practice.  
- PI not signing the source worksheets in time but later after CRA spot the missing signatures  
- PI not recording AEs on EMR but rather use paper-based worksheets as source documents, making it easier to edit the source data (also means he or she was not serious on AEs when assessing the patients  
- Having a diagnosis only because the drug needs to be under health insurance coverage but then no documentation exists to say ""this is only for the insurance purpose, the patient doesn't actually have stomach ulcer"" As for why then the doctor prescribe it? because he thought NSAID will be hard on stomach lining. 

Understanding GCP but not implement it or ignore it

- Study coordinator (research nurse) being more familar with the criteria than PI or simply call CRA whenever they want to know something about the protocol.  
- PI not wanting to meet CRA because we are not medical rep who would bring coffee or sushi bento box to him. We ended up creating an issue on MV report every 2 visits and every resolution will be ""we will follow up with letter or give him a call"". Common scenario is you won't see PI within 6 months.   
- Sponsor or CRO hired start up specialists creating IRB submission packages for PI. There's no law saying you couldn't hire someone to do things for PI but we still write ""PI is preparing for the new protocol submission to IRB with the assistance of start up specialists"" in MV report. :) Schizophrenic much right?  
- CRA fills out protocol deviation report to IRB. PI onlt has to press submit. Some IRB even allow CRA to fill their names in ""name of the reporter"" column.   
- CRA fills out SAE report and give it to site staff to sign. But study coordinator will charge SAE reporting fee.   
- severe delayed data entry and delayed query resolution and because study coordinator's English proficiency is less than subpar so CRA has to translate queries and write the answer for them.   
- PI or SC will ask CRA how to document important decision, only to make sure the wording is comprehensive enough. It goes to show they don't know what comprehensive documentation looks like. 

Despite everything that I shared above, I don't see any truly diabolical and unethical behavious in my clinical research career in APAC. I don't see paitents being enrolled without a consent. I don't see data being fraudulaent (oh well I've never handled studies in China so I can't attest about whether 80% data from China is falsified). I don't see PI coerces patients to do anything.

Set the expectation you want to hear their voice every visit. Even when I go on site, most the PIs still only want to meet by phone (oncology). Even if it is a week or two after the visit, I insist on that call.

Most of these are less than 5 minute conversations. Sometimes I have chatty PIs or ones that like to ask questions but usually you just word vomit to them, ask if they have any questions (they won’t) and then end of discussion.

I'm lucky I got out a couple years ago; it wasn't great while I was there, but it sounds like it's been getting *substantially* worse since then.

I wish you nothing but the best; hopefully you'll be able to find something else soon!

If it's worth anything to know, I think once the federal reserve reduces interest rates back towards normal, which will hopefully be within a couple of months, the industry as a whole will start growing again, at which point you'll likely have a lot more employment prospects.

Right now, the whole industry is struggling because interest rates are so high that they basically kill any pharma company's desire to do clinical trials research.",mathnstats

I’ll even throw some in from when I worked in academia too.

There are countless policies, big and small, that exist but aren’t enforced. The company’s culture is build by standard practices and expectations of recent practice, especially as the vast majority of their workforce has been hired in the last five years.

With that people said, there have been shifts in enforcement of procedures and policies, but there is always ample warning and roll-out. Always. This was the first time that it was announced via a separate bonus that was ambiguous and not clearly shown as helping them enforce WFH compliance.

I have no problem with people getting fired that didn’t adhere by the policy. The company hired you, not your manager, so I would rely on what the company says, not your manager regarding policies like this. However, having it be a bonus, right after the CEO mentions that bonuses are lower for various reasons seems incredibly strange and vaguely motivated by more than boosting stock prices by highlighting efficiency because the end of the quarter.

In academia, standard practice and what was adhered to was actually more enforceable than our collective bargaining contract. In short, if you can’t understand how the way they went about this destroys morale, there may not be much hope for you.",Drmomo4

I think my post was pretty explanatory. I’m not sure how else to word what I said more clearly. It’s completely destroyed morale, even for us who are complaint. There are numerous policies that could impact bonuses, like phishing test failures and completing exams/signing off on SOPs, but they are clearly communicated by day 1.

Forget about people who were fired. There is a WFH bank in-office people get, and without any notification or warning, people got an extra bonus for not using up a given benefit. And that’s actually why they started enforcing it - people that were getting an extra bonus were clearly (to some) never in the office.

Day to day tasks can vary significantly from leading study meetings, creating agendas, study plans, updating the business (r&d, medical, business leadership etc) legal and contract meetings, external vendor meetings and bid discussion, generating and updating project plans, meeting with function leads, developing ICF, overseeing DM activities, reviewing and redlining site/CRO budgets and more. if you have multiple studies then multiple meetings per day for different studies.

Clinical risk assessment and follow up is big. I would recommend getting familiar with that.

You are the head of the snake and if shits not going well it’s your job to explain what’s going on. Good PMs communicate often and early. Any delays or updates need to go to the team and action items need to be followed up and not sat on.

Good PM are on top of their shit and can break down a study, the status, risks, pain points at a moments notice.

clinicalresearch,Budget finance analyst position ,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1clo9t0/budget_finance_analyst_position/,2,5,"Depends on your background.  If you have experience as a finance analyst, in FP&A, etc. it’s about the same as landing a similar role anywhere else.

If you have experience in the industry (finance, clinops, or otherwise), you will be at quite the advantage since you know the tasks being budgeted and have a general idea of the effort that will go into the tasks being budgeted.

The title or structure of these roles is different at every company.  On the CRO side, some may have “Commercial Finance Analysts” or “Business Analysts” that handle budgets, proposals, contracts, or some mixture of those.  Others may be more specific and have Bidders, Proposal Analysts, Contract Analysts, etc. that will handle clinical trial budgets, but at different stages of the process. 

Biggest tips on landing a role are:

1.Be solid in Excel (XLookup, pivot tables, If formulas, etc) and have a good understanding of how to calculate things like gross margin. 

2. Have Knowledge of different billing types and budget structures such as unitized, time and materials, milestone-based, etc.

3. Have the ability to draft contractual language if your role will also handle any contract documents

4. Have good answers for when you get asked about your ability to communicate with clients/executives and your time management skills.  Time management will be a hot topic because these roles have lots of tight turnaround times and strict deadlines.

5. Get an internal referral. Unless being headhunted, I’m not hearing much, if any, success with just applying.  A referral that gets you in touch with a recruiter is crucial.

There is no requirement by US FDA or ICH GCP to “stamp” anything. They are required to document favorable opinion (ICH GCP 3.1.2) but there is no national regulatory requirement to “stamp” things.

clinicalresearch,Questions about database unlock/unfreeze during a Phase III trial with interim analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1clcu0q/questions_about_database_unlockunfreeze_during_a/,5,23,"There are not really explicit guidelines on this AFAIK. My general advice would be that the principles of GCP require us to deliver accurate results from clinical trials regarding the therapeutics under investigation. As a result, you should generally come to the conclusion that items impacting primary/key secondary/secondary endpoints or key safety data (SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, etc.) probably fall into the category of not being consistent with GCP. But the ""how"" that is addressed in this particular situation are likely to be logistically complicated depending on if you're already filed your initial BLA, or if you have filed but are now doing a new data cut to submit as a major amendment, etc.

Nonetheless this is not your call alone. This is a decision that needs to be made in conjunction with data management, pharmacovigilance, stat programming, medical, stats, clinical, and honestly probably the C-suite if it's a ""small"" company as you say.  If that's not already the SOP at your company, then it should be and whoever wrote the SOP doesn't know what they are doing.

Since this is an interim dataset, the logistics of unlocking/relocking can be very, very messy. For example, if you re-pull the AE database after unlocking to update this datapoint, it can be difficult to guarantee that nothing else was changed in the database by the sites (e.g. the site added another AE later which technically would have occurred during the intended analysis period).

(the exact logistics depend a bit on how DM locked down the exact forms. Sometimes DM can unlock just a single form, but not always )

At the very least, the principles you need to follow are that you should expect to explain to an auditor what happened, how the issue was addressed, why you did it that way, that you recognize and documented this was a potential data integrity issue, and to produce documentation which clearly shows how that process was executed. Among those things, as you alluded, are performing proc compares of before/after datasets and the corresponding TFLs to ensure that the expected changes in the outputs match what was updated in the database. But there are other considerations, e.g. whether ALL TFLs should be rerun to ensure that timestamps are properly aligned, etc.

I would start there and talk to your DM team.

In terms of making the call on whether to unfreeze/unlock to make corrections and/or updates, that should be a whole SMT discussion and pros/cons weighed. I would consider all of the following: What is the data cut being used for? Is it for internal use or for submission? What is the nature and scope of the data changes needed? Are there other ways to document the data issues without unlocking? Are sites available to make updates, including PIs to re-sign (I assume Yes in this case)?",hagl

For us DM get to know spec char by two methods:

1) at a agreed frequency Programmers run a special char report to list out all spec chars from EDC. 

2) Bios would pick spec chars in dry run before any deliverables.

 DM would then query site to correct it on EDC. example:  wouldn't is updated with would not.

The best advice I have for inspection is if it's not documented, then it didn't happen. The real concern most likely isn't whether a single data point will impact the approvability of your BLA-- that would be extraordinarily unusual and, to be honest, if one single data point can swing it your drug is probably not very good anyway. The main risk is losing credibility in the submission process and inspection findings.

If the BLA is already submitted, I would definitely be having conversations with regulatory team about what our options are. If it hasn't gone out the door yet, your options are probably either (i) unlock the form and re-pull the database, rerun entire SDTM/ADaM/TFL package and re-QC to ensure the only change is the one you expect or (ii) leave the database as it is, but document the change in the CSR. 

 Again, the biggest risk is most likely the perception that the company doesn't know what they're doing ( not a great sign that there was a data issue in topline reporting for a pivotal study) and that you didn't properly have oversight of your CRO or weren't following your established processes. Documenting the issue and rerunning the TFL package to correct is the most transparent IMO. If the logistics of that are impossible with a live database, then document why it was felt to be impossible and how you mitigated it.

That being said, the DMP is a living document. You can (and expect) to have revisions over the course of a study.

Grant funds are not driving this industry.
2) The reason trials are done here is both because we consume so many drugs and FDA requires so much specific testing in order to market a drug here. Companies essentially HAVE to test here if they want to sell here. But that only means the patients need to be here. There’s no reason the CRO or pharma staff do. Many of these are large multinational companies. This is like saying that every company that wants to do business with the US has to do that business IN the USA rather than WITH the USA.

They literally exist to identify where the data didn’t follow the stated protocol, which is important. Because your handing a huge protocol to regulators, scientists, physicians and other people that care about your data and you’re saying “we ran this study on x number of subjects based on these exact parameters” and protocol deviations are how you identify anywhere and everywhere those exact parameters weren’t true. 

Which is a very important part of the scientific method for many reasons, but mainly for reproducibility of results. 

Any study involving real people is going to have deviations. In fact, it’s a huge red flag if it doesn’t. And yes, sites and sponsors both have to try and follow the protocol to the best of their ability, but shit happens. The important part is documenting what happened and why, and periodically reviewing to see if there are trends that are occurring that indicate poor procedures at the site, a poorly devised protocol, bad vendor processes, etc.

Just like we expect sites to identify deviations and take corrective and preventative measures for significant or repeated issues, regulators also hold sponsors accountable if there are widespread deviations that indicate study procedures aren’t able to be followed by sites, and the sponsor did nothing to address the issue. 

I get push back nearly everyday from sites when they get a deviation because a subject was out of town and didn’t do their visit in window, or they couldn’t collect a PK in time because the subjects veins were bad and they couldn’t get a stick, or other similar things. They feel like “well it’s not our fault, so it’s not a deviation”. But that’s not how deviations work. They simply indicate where the protocol was not followed, regardless of fault. 

You discuss fault when you take and document corrective and preventative actions, which you cannot do if you don’t address that there was a deviation in the first place. 

It really is so refreshing when people understand the purpose of deviations is not to “tell on you” or “make you look bad” or any number of other things that I’ve heard people say in response to being issued a very clear deviation. 

Sites that identify and document when a deviation occurs, and take quick corrective and preventative actions to address them are worth their weight in gold and also seem to have much happier, less stressed out staff.",Bingo-Bango-Bong-o

We have one right now where it's a 'safety' deviation if the PI doesn't log in and sign off in 72 hours of EDC entry of SAE --- AND every change to the SAE entry. The PI still has to do the paper log and sign there, but submitting the paper is not enough for this sponsor. They require the PI sign into the EDC and verify that the CRC entered everything correctly. It's maddening trying to chase down these PIs!  We have two sites and normally when there is an SAE, they are never in the same office as me.
On top of that, if the SAE has to be reported to safety, a ""dynamic"" form shows up in the EDC. We asked for the questions in a format similar to the EDC guide and were told they don't have anything like that because the form is dynamic and changes based on your response to a question. We literally had to make our own source by waiting for an event, then pushing every button and recording the Q/As.

I was forced to keep PI login info for accounts, login for them, and tell them where to sign bc they wouldn't keep up with their own account and didn't follow any emails to know something had to be signed or where to do it. When I replaced the previous CRC and told the PI to sign for something, the PI said they didn't have the login bc the other CRC kept it for them. I found out the CRC had both created and managed all the PIs accounts for every study system so that responsibility is was passed to me. I'm certain the previous CRC also signed everything on their behalf with or without the PIs knowledge. 


I tried to keep things ethical by logging in to site and navigating to the signature portion, having the PI sit in front of the computer where it asks them to sign, and briefly explain what they are signing so they would sign themselves, and I would send a follow up email with a ""thank you for signing ____ for study ___ today so we can ____"" just covering my as for the day the PI says ""I never signed that"" or ""I wasn't made aware that was my responsibility"" ...


I also had to schedule and reschedule their meetings with monitors for every IMV and the PI would regularly not show up and I would reschedule again and again just for these monitors to get 5 min with the PI. 


On the day I gave my 1 week notice, I scheduled a meeting with the PI and the hospital adin to explain the objective facts for why I was leaving which included the PI avoiding all their responsibilities for the site, expecting me to manage them for the PI, and not being qualified nor compensated nor supported to be able to do that in their place.",ceilingmoth

1. If you have your information in a database where you can pull reports, amend your SOP to be q2weeks.Then when you say it's your SOP to do pre-screen reports every 2 weeks, it's true.
2. If they push back, you can then negotiate time or money. If they want them weekly, you say our fee for that is xx, whatever amounts to having the CRC work an extra hour or so on that protocol. If money isn't enough, negotiate time. You can say okay I will send the report weekly, but only have a recruiting update call monthly to balance the time spent.
3. This one is easier if you have a lot of screeners reviewing patient charts in clinic or in hopsitals. Overwhelm them. Send in hundreds of prescreens a month and explain that a lot of people qualify but you cannot reach them all due to being only one person. I have had a couple sponsors tell me to stop sending them 😀
4. Leverage your budget. Once we were budgeted to pre-screen 50 patients and then enter them into an external database. Once we hit 50, I offered to renew our original rate for another 50 via a budget amendment. Until the amendment was made, no more patients entered. We just received word on that trial that enrollment is closed and we never received an amendment!
5. Budget suggestion #2... explain your fees for spending time with monitors. Our line items include on-site, remote with redaction of source, remote without redaction of source, monitor calls up to 30 min once a month. Explain to the sponsor that twice weekly contact with the recruiters was not budgeted into your time, like the monitoring was, and offer to add a line item for recruitment calls. For every single monitor contact in your budget, require they send a recap via email so that you can submit it with an invoice for your time. Sometimes this is enough to get the recruitment people to back off. If you are always answering emails, generating reports, talking to sponsors, when can you enroll?
6. Play 'hardball', especially effective when you are enrolling at a pace that matches your contracted amount of patients. Just don't answer the email/call. Then when you come back, apologize for the delay, offer  an excuse (you were enrolling/doing xyz for their trial), and give them what they want on your timeline. Last I checked there were no deviations for not talking to a recruitment associate. The worst that could happen is that they 'tell on you'. I always recommend having your management/PI on board with these ideas prior to implementation.
Realizing that you do not have to do everything the sponsor asks for every study has transformed my view of site based research. The site is like its own business. That means the site (generally) owns their data, develops their own SOPs, and negotiates their own budget. Responding to every crazy request a monitor has asked of me used to drive me nuts. Now I ask them to show me where it is required ( like a monitoring plan from the sponsor) or I push back in my own ways.
I hope this helps. The monitor and the recruiter being two separate people has doubled our sponsor time. Can you tell its a pet peeve of mine?!?!?!",ResearchNerdOnABeach

My implementation manager took us aside this week and tried to brainstorm deviation “elimination” tactics because upper management is cracking down on the number of deviations.

Yes, deviations happen, and yes, they should generally be avoided where possible, but this method of handling them is the wrong way to do it and it’s going to lead to non-reporting because people are too afraid of the SVP or an admin questioning them.

About 8 years ago I was a 5-year member of an IRB at a major medical center and one of the cancer studies we reviewed at annual review had just over 100 deviations, which sounds terrible.
The person submitting the annual review asked the IRB to make comment about the deviations in the meeting minutes. The reviewer said over 95% of the deviations were related to patients either being too ill to come to a visit, or they chose to go to a family event before having their next research visit/treatment. He said the patient’s actions were reasonable because it was a very sick population and they have the right to tend to, or enjoy quality of life moments, and there was no cause for concern because the 5% staff errors weren’t anything that put patients at risk, just minor reminders with no need for formal re-training.

But this is why many sites have an SOP that outlines the process for implementing amended ICFs. It does protect them from these types of unnecessary PDs. Sites that have experience under their belt will have an SOP that says something like “Upon receipt of IRB-approved ICF, the consent will be distributed to the PI and study team by regulatory coordinator and the staff will have up to 2 business days to review the consent for training purposes, before it is implemented at the site and used to consent/re-consent study subjects.” These sites will also have a consent log or other documentation that shows “date of implementation” of the consent, and that should be the date it was truly distributed and ready to be used to consent study subjects.",Bingo-Bango-Bong-o

I agree a lot of protocols are poorly written but a lot of the things that were mentioned in regards to hospital staff not wanting to follow a protocol aren’t going to be fixed by writing better protocols. 

Every country/hospital/clinical team/Investigator has their own standard of care for certain processes, so it’s not possible to write a protocol that fits what the clinical staff does in normal practice and you have to have standard procedures across sites for many things in a clinical trial. 

So the issues expressed with the hospital staff aren’t ever going to be addressed just by writing better protocols.

It’s actually pretty wild how much each site varies in what they want in a protocol.

End of. Any half decent investigator should understand that. 

If investigators don’t like a protocol, they should refuse to do the study. Federal regulations, GCP, the contract they sign, and the 1572 they sign all say that they will follow the protocol as written, except in very specific circumstances to protect subjects. 

They have no right to not follow the protocol because they don’t think it impacts the data. It very much does. 

You brought the problem up, and it is a real problem. A lot of staff that straddle both worlds (clinical and research) seem to have very poor understanding of how research actually works and the consequences of their actions. They also tend to value clinical work much higher, which means research often gets put on the back burner, deprioritized, or requirements are treated more like suggestions. 

Not following the protocol has a very detrimental impact on the data. Data is often thrown out because the protocol was not followed. Regulators and sponsors take it very seriously. Investigators can be blacklisted, lose their license, even be jailed (in extreme cases of blatant fraud). 

I will repeat again: I agree that many, if not most, protocols are poorly written and sponsors must do better. But the way to handle that as an investigator/site is to vet studies well during feasibility and startup and refuse to take on studies that you know you can’t be compliant with.

Number 1 because investigators/sites are required to follow the protocol by law and by contract and the consequences to themselves and to the sponsor are very bad when they don’t and Number 2 because the most effective way to get sponsors to write better protocols is when they can’t find any sites to take their studies because their protocols are shit.",Bingo-Bango-Bong-o

Generally speaking, studies fall into 3 buckets-- Dose finding/safety, proof of concept, and pivotal/registrational. 

For the former two, I would say that modifications to study design generally don't matter, so long as they support the goal of answering the question of ""what is the MTD/optimal dose of the treatment"" or ""does the treatment work in one or any patient populations"". Protocol amendments are a pain in the tushy, so nobody is going to bother amending a protocol that doesn't help accomplish one of those things. 

Pivotal/registrational studies are more complicated. The ideal answer is always ""don't modify the study design"", because essentially any time you do once it's initiated, the integrity of the study can potentially be called into question. That said, shit happens. Studies take a very long time and are very expensive. Often we are trying to power a phase 3 study for overall survival when we had only very limited data in phase 2, or for example only mature progression free survival data without mature OS data. A new therapy which changes the standard of care in our comparator arm may have gotten approved. A competitor might have come out with new data that would suggest the bar we were aiming for would not be competitive. There's lots and lots and lots of things that can go wrong there where modifying the existing study design, generally in blinded fashion with oversight from data monitoring committees, is a better move than trudging ahead for several years and several hundred million dollars with an old design that doesn't quite make sense. 

So, generally, in pivotal/registrational studies such modifications can work ok as long as the study is still blinded and it's relatively early on in enrollment. If you are very late in enrollment and/or the study is already unblinded, you are probably kinda up the creek.",Puzzleheaded_Soil275

It sounds like this is IRB or IRB-adjacent, in which case your line should be the usual remit of the IRB - ensuring the study design is ethical, that it doesn’t harm participants, and that it complies with all pertinent laws and regulations. 

If the problem is just that a study is “too complicated”, in my opinion, that’s not a problem at all, unless you can articulate a specific reason it could harm patients. A vague sense that a study is “too much” compared to what you’re used to seeing isn’t a good reason to reject it, especially since the whole point of this approach to trial design is to do more early on.",Johnny_Appleweed

I have a good friend who did the whole tuition reimbursement piece at a large CRO and would now LIKE to jump ship and move elsewhere for more opportunity, but is a bit tied down for a while due to the terms of the reimbursement (they have to work a certain number of years or they have to immediately pay back the entire benefit) unless they’re ready to hand over about 20k in cash to the CRO.

It's a hard jump to make, but if you can make it I think it's well worth it. To be honest, your wife is very entry level. A lot of sponsors and CRO's want you you to have experience working for other sponsors and CRO's first and appreciate site side experience second making it hard to make this change. Also, entry level roles are not going to be as nice and I'd suggest being more open to travel and relocation (at least for 2 to 3 years to build her resume). 
This is the advice I'd give her. Remote is more competitive than in person and large companies are more competitive than smaller companies. She might find more luck looking for an in person job at a small biotech company (sub 10,000 employees). I'd also suggest updating her resume frequently, if she's not hearing back after 10-20 applications it might be a resume issue.
Lastly, I will say now is a bad time to be making this swap. A lot of these major companies are taking cost saving measures. I know of at least 3 or 4 major names that are trying to move their entry level junior roles over seas to reduce costs. This won't be permanent but it's going to be hard for her to find a job for the next year.

To justify extra people, my staff had to put in at least 45-50 hours a week, and as a manager a 10-hour day was the minimum expectation. That way we could justify hiring at least one new employee. It was pitched as a way to use the system to increase our headcount, and as a new manager I was naive enough to believe it. 

At my next review I brought up the conversation about bringing in one or two more people and was told that we were doing a great job and that rather than bringing in another employee that we’d be getting larger raises based on our performance.  So when the reviews came, most of my staff earned the exceeds expectations or even an advancing rating, meaning they were ready for management.  But because reviews go through management, my director informed me that the exec had moved most people down a whole rating, so exceeds became meets, and advancing became exceeds. The average raise was between 2.5%-3.5% and we lost ten staff in the next eight months.  

I went to HR because the downgrades to performance reviews, the promise to hire additional resources based on overtime and a few other documented conversations.

That being said, unless you have a SOP that says otherwise, you CAN absolutely complete the DOA ahead of the SIV. I’ve seen it before as a way to ensure things are in place right away so a site can be activated the moment the SIV is over. There’s no regulation against it, and the regulations do not specify any gate keeping to completing a DOA or timing as to when it should be in place - just that it should exist while you’re doing the study and while those delegated staff are doing those things. Hell, the PI can make their own DOA, they don’t have to use the sponsor’s. 

The PI just has to ensure that anyone delegated is appropriately qualified to do that task before they do it. That’s completely up to the PI unless the protocol specifies otherwise.",NoButton4892

clinicalresearch,Signing DOA for a new study,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cja02d/signing_doa_for_a_new_study/,12,25,"It is generally fine to complete it before the SIV, but the potential issue I see with a lot of sites is their DOA or SOP states that by signing they or the PI are attesting that you're trained. If you can't complete it because you're not trained yet then the sponsor should understand that you need to abide by your SOP. Really they just want to get ahead and make sure you're ready to hit the ground running because DOA logs are one of those things that a lot of sites take FUCKING FOREVER to figure out after SIV then run into issues with someone working on the study before they are delegated.  

My recommendation if you can't have everyone sign it is that you just list everyone's names, roles and tasks, and just hold off on the start date and signature until the SIV. The start date can even maybe be before the SIV. This will give your CRA and sponsor contacts a lot of confidence that it's at least being worked on.

Depending on the delegation log, nearly all of them state that when the PI signs, they are attesting they have been trained for the role/tasks assigned.

The Delegation Log only serves to show what tasks the staff are being delegated to by the PI. The delegation log has nothing to do with training, it is a separate item completely. Training, IF required (as there are plenty of instances where training is not required if the task is part of their staff member’s normal scope of practice), should be captured on a separate training log document - and the training log is what should be signed at a SIV. All that matters is that a staff member is delegated AND has their required training in place before doing study tasks. So if they do a study task on 01May24, and they were delegated on 01Jan24 per the delegation log and trained on 01Apr24 on the protocol at the SIV per their training log, there is no issue, because they didn’t do any study task until both delegation and training had occurred.

And again, we really prefer PIs to hold off on signing a DOA log until the SIV is completed.  But it is a gold standard preference, not a requirement. 

FDA guidance on the DOA states: “The Investigator should maintain a list of the appropriately qualified persons to whom significant trial-related duties have been delegated. This list should also describe the delegated tasks, identify the training the individuals have received that qualifies them to perform delegated tasks (e.g. can refer to an individual’s CV on file), and identify the dates of involvement in the study.” 

As the FDA and regulations are vague on the specifics (they don’t even mention using a training log!), so unless there is a sponsor required training matrix that is also cited in the protocol, PI can technically determine on their own what “training” means. If PI wants to say they hosted a meeting before the SIV to review the protocol in depth with their team and list that somewhere, great, they certainly can do that.

Falsifying study data is something entirely different and involving the data being collected on study subjects. Not regulatory documents.

What exactly do you think a delegation log is? Because it sounds like you are confusing it with training documentation. Delegation log has nothing to do with an SIV other than I usually makes sense to complete it at the SIV. The delegation log is not necessarily where SIV training is documented and it is frequently documented separately because not everyone joins the SIV and some are trained and delegated later. There is no falsifying happening if nobody is claiming to be trained when they were not. 

I have seen far more delegation logs signatures with dates before or after SIV, and these documents have been seen by countless people and been through audits and inspections and nobody has said anything because there is no issue with the PI delegating someone before or after the SIV.

clinicalresearch,Big CROs vs smaller companies?,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cj8tq1/big_cros_vs_smaller_companies/,11,11,"Depending on what your education is and where you live, a large Phase-I CRO could provide the training you want and need, and also offer opportunities for career advancement. You may need to relocate to the Drug Belt (eastern USA area) or to one of several CROs that are in other states. I worked at a large Phase I site and it was fun, fast-paced, interesting, and taught me a lot. I'm non-clinical, and I had my undergrad degree when I started there, so I was in a management area not requiring a clinical degree. 

That CRO trained staff members on phlebotomy and other skills study teams needed to have. I believe they had an education benefit, and I know for certain they had a profit-sharing program. From what I could tell, it was a great place for new people in the industry to get excellent experience and grow into other positions. That was years ago and I am still in touch with many of the people I met there. 

There are several large oncology CROs as well, and that part of drug research is still growing. Those sites may or may not have in-house units, but subjects in their studies have numerous outpatient visits over long periods of time. Based on what I know (I'm an IRB Board Member now, so I see studies all the time), there are likely staff members who do vitals, draw samples, etc. as well as medical professionals subjects see when on visits. 

Regarding smaller companies - you may want to make certain they have an ongoing need for whatever you want to do. One reason CROs are so popular (and needed) now is that drug and device companies often can't afford to have units or departments that conduct subject-level research. They focus on getting a drug or device developed to where it can be researched in humans, and then might work with a CRO (for drugs) or locate and contract with external investigators (for devices, as well as for drugs that are in later stages of human research).

Going from site, to cro, then to sponsor - there needs to be improvements with LIRB, Advarra, & WCG. 

Advarra is the best imo despite there is disruption with their teams like it is every where. 

1. Sites that use utilize LIRB solo, certificate to waiver to central, or ""central as local"" need to give the sponsor/cro reps a detailed process and meeting times/submission deadlines when SSU begins. Cro/sponsor needs to know what you will work on before submission or concurrent with submission.  Also ethic boards need the same information sent to sponsor/cro ssu reps. Do not leave us in the dark for ffs.  We have dates planned for sites based on historics and study needs and we need to get you ready in a timely manner 

2. Advarra and wcg: I like them both. I do prefer advarra tho since forms are built in with in and there are no smart forms to download and re-upload like wcg has. I do wish there was a way to list the approval and tne approved documents grouped together.. advarra has the best tho when reviewing approvals and approved docs in chronological order. 

3. Give the sites a chance to review and approve the ICFs and then allow the sponsor/cro to sign off.  Advarra does good on this if instructed to. 

4. Wcg - I do not like how it is set up with box tabs to action items, submissions, etc.  I do like I can easily find a site tho especially if I have a site on multi studies and trying to audits. 

5. Central IRBs need better training/videos for sites on submissions, continuing reviews, ICF reviews etc. Ultimately, it is the sites responsibility to train their staff on the IRBs. It would be nice if the IRB set an expectation/training as part of having an account with them imo.",dayswasted1804

For one, it makes absolutely no sense that they require previous research experience as a nurse. You’re not going to have it because that role is an entry level position. I have *never* seen a hospital/clinic require a nurse to step back in their career as CRC, then back to a CRN. That makes no sense.

They can however require that you have pertinent experience, such as oncology, but that’s really all I have seen, but not CRC before CRN. You’re a nurse, not a coordinator. 

Also, please look at other hospitals around you or other clinics. If that place you’re applying to is strict, then maybe somewhere else might be a bit easier to get into.

I would ask a nurse or a tech to draw labs for me... as did our nurse CRCs most of the time because they weren't totally comfortable with it unless there was no other option. I cross trained on my nurse CRC coworkers' studies and would fill in when they went on vacation doing all the visit tasks. When we recruit for coordinators, we would set the salary commensurate with education and experience, so RNs would make more. No shade to nurses but what I'm trying to say is a nurse taking a job that's listed as CRC is not a ""step back"".

3. Reach out to your IRB contact asking for clarification on this process, and attach any documentation your director has sent you telling you to sign in and complete the training on behalf of the PI. If they’re a halfway decent IRB that will be an immediate red flag and they should launch an investigation. 
4. Reach out to your sponsor/CRO contact to confirm if it’s ok for you to do these trainings on behalf of your PI. If they’re halfway decent at their jobs, this should be escalated and result in a conversation by them with the PI.

For many it’s really more important to give patients the best opportunity and chance to live rather than completing a training on a updated Log or form.

It’s literally impossible to manage everything when you are a KOL and start being crossbombed by every team/sponsor/cro. Seen many SCs doing this but on the other hand the PI will take responsibility if something is missing, because without the precious coordinators work HE will be under the bus in no time.

Tl;dr is that EU CTR equalises processes across the EU (losing previous advantages), and 
Belgium is fairly expensive. 


Personally, I'm not sure how big of a deal this really is. Is EU CTR a headache for sponsors? Yes. Will it shift the country balance within the EU from high-cost to low-cost EU? I have my doubts. That option was always there, and the old national procedures in the EU were not that prohibitive. If you wanted to go to Eastern Europe before, you could.

At the end of day it's about recruitment potential and competing trials, existing infrastructure, good experience with investigators, and similar things.

Recruitment potential is another thing. Belgium healthcare and reimbursement is great, meaning that patients have less incentives (monetary) to participate, so that impacts recruitment for some indications.

However, anyone that has worked in both regions, knows quality of life is infinitely better in Europe while you can make more money in the U.S. There are pros and cons depending on what you want.

I do feel European CRAs are somewhat underpaid but also tend to have a much better work-life balance. It used to be standard when I started in the U.S. to get 10 days of paid vacation a year. You were lucky if you got 15 and anything more was unheard of. Many places went to unlimited PTO which aggravated the problem with people even being scared to take days 10-15 days off a year. In Europe, 30-40 days is not uncommon. Then there’s health insurance in one versus the other. And, so much more. However, in terms of raw dollars made, you’ll be better off in the U.S.

That’s why many people, including me, work in the U.S. for the money but will retire in Europe for quality of life and healthcare. Off topic, but I wanted to clarify the people are talking about European CRA salaries.",clinicalresearchguy

Ultimately, whether or not the program is worth the investment depends on your goals and how you believe the MS degree will help you achieve them.

If your goal is to obtain a green card and stay in the US after OPT, it is possible. You could potentially start with an academic job and apply for an H1B visa afterwards, or you may work diligently during your MS to accumulate journal publications and apply for an NIW green card. However, there are risks to consider, such as finding a job that sponsors your H1B visa after OPT and the uncertainty of the H1B visa lottery process. Additionally, it's important to assess the clinical research job market in your home country and determine if an NYU MS degree would enhance your prospects there.

It may take many years of work to recoup your tuition expenses, especially considering the high cost of living in NYC. So ultimately, it all depends on what your goals are.

CR professionals understand protocol amendment as... You have your trial with a current protocol and you make changes to the trial that lead to a higher protocol version. 


21 CFR 312 as a whole is about INDs, and curiously, under contents of the IND (21 CFR 312.23) it groups the details of participating investigators as part of the protocol requirement. Now, no sane sponsor actually has the Investigator/site details listed within the protocol. Instead, they separately submit CV/FDA 1572. But from a purely regulatory perspective, you are submitting part of the protocol when submitting a site. Hence the FDA considers it a protocol amendment to the IND when the sponsor adds a new site to an ongoing trial (and it's classified as such on the submission cover sheet, the 1571).

As someone who builds EDCs day in and day out… I want you to identify the fields you want on each CRF, but I don’t want you to get lost in the weeds trying to specify the logic you -think- should be triggering those fields to display. I don’t need you specifying the field format, or indentations, or suggesting which fields need non-conformant edit checks to fire. If something is unclear or could be designed more efficiently, I’ll propose some options and ask for your feedback.  I spend ALL DAY looking at less-than-ideal CRF builds, so I can advise you on avoiding the mistakes of your peers and build something more robust, if you let me. Biggest mistakes I see: designing like the eCRF is on paper; forgetting the end user experience; asking for the same exact datapoint in multiple places / in the wrong form 

If you have a crappy EDC builder: None of the above applies; specify every single detail 

A visit schedule is fine, but know that I am going to trust the protocol over your Visit Schedule tab.  Don’t get caught up specifying precisely how visits / folders / matrices should roll out; this can be discussed with your builder directly. 

Contacts should be separately maintained outside of CRF specs.
Instructions: I probably wouldn’t find this too useful unless the study is super complex.
Special specs: Again, don’t overthink or over-dictate this, unless your builder sucks

Edit: I personally would not like the standard variable code book tab at all. I’d rather you only specified the basics of each field on the form itself, and I’ll determine if variables need to be re-used.  This is an example of over-engineering, IMO",throwaway28492432

I won't let us start building in-house until we update our SOPs (which right now cover our sponsor oversight). If you have that all well in hand, though, feel free to ignore.

The other thing I'd encourage you to consider with template creation like this is at a small company you have more stakeholders than just other DM & programming -- so making any of your documents / mock ups as non-DM reader friendly as you can.  What you are describing sounds great and captures the big stuff, but a medical monitor or CTM is probably going to want to see all the available options for a proposed drop down on the CRF tab, not have to go looking for the code list elsewhere.",Einahpetsreads

Yes, and they're a bit unique, in a way.

There are basically 2 types of databases we're building:

One is the sort of standard CRO EDC system.

The other, which I've been put in charge of designing, is a sort of EDC system that's divorced from any clinical trial, and just used by the sites for their own purposes (so they can collect and analyze their own data more efficiently).

But, for both, we want to have a standardized method for communicating to the programming team what the requirements are for a new study, for functional changes, etc.

Basically, just a standardized CRF Specs template that will work for both worlds.

>I'm hoping to start one of our new studies that way towards the end of the year and I'm super excited. 

That's awesome! Bigger projects like this are super exciting!!

>My concern would be first about SOPs for your build and validation process, and also how you describe it in the DMP.

So... That's where things are a bit interesting... Currently, even for the CRO side of the business, there basically aren't any SOPs yet; only within the last year has the company gone from a 6 person team to a 60 person team, so no one has really had much time for documentation and defining processes yet. It's still very much in the ""flying by the seat of your pants"" stage of things. There are currently several people working to improve the documentation and process definitions, but it's still a bit behind.

And for the side I'm working on, that isn't directly connected to any clinical trial, there isn't even a DMP or anything, as we won't really be doing much data management directly; all of the data belongs to and is controlled by the sites, we're just giving them the tools they need to collect, analyze, and share their data, more or less.

While we still do need SOPs and whatnot, it's a bit of a greyer area than most clinical EDC systems (even on the CRO side, the contracts we have are designed in such a way that puts us in a bit of a regulatory grey area).

>The other thing I'd encourage you to consider with template creation like this is at a small company you have more stakeholders than just other DM & programming

At this particular company, it really is just the DMs and programmers that would use the document; upper management is kind of great in that they put full faith in the employees to do what they know is right, so there isn't a lot of micromanaging from other departments or anything.

And the programmers are pretty much all in India (and it's only a team of 6 devs), and their English isn't especially great; we have one go-between person, the CTO, so my primary goal with the document is to try to make communication between the American DMs and the Indian programmers as simple, clear, and consistent as possible.

That said, based on what you and someone else said, I might scrap the standard variable codebook idea; to me, it seemed like a decent way to reduce redundant work and make any modifications to standard fields a bit more readily apparent.

My thought was that, for example, if the options for gender are so consistently the same, it can be easy to miss when they're slightly different for a particular study, so if you have a standard that you can reference, then specify when it needs to be modified and exactly what about it needs modification, it might prevent issues of ""oops, I saw gender and assumed it'd be the same as usual, so didn't actually read the full specification for it"".

Does that make sense?

Maybe there's a better way to avoid that sort of thing, or maybe I'm just over engineering a solution to a problem that isn't as likely as I fear it could be. Idk.

Thank you for your thoughtful feedback, though!! I really appreciate it!! I'll try talking with my boss about prioritizing SOPs more; I do agree with you that they *should* come first, but there's also a lot of pressure to deliver the products we've been promising people, so it can be a tough sell to justify any delay in the product for the sake of documentation, ya know?",mathnstats

So linkedin is disheartening, soul sucking, and yeah, maybe some of the positions posted are fakes... but the real ones get posted there too, and sometimes messaging people is what will ultimately land you a job.",Acceptable-Owl-8856

clinicalresearch,PPD/ThermoFisher,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1chrfbp/ppdthermofisher/,73,91,"I suspect that the fairly recent uptick in layoffs throughout the industry over the past year or so has to do with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates (in an attempt to combat inflation, supposedly).

With higher interest rates on loans, companies are less likely to take out loans to fund things like clinical trials.

As a result, there basically isn't enough business in the industry to support the same number of workers that it was before (because, of course, executives and shareholders settling for slightly lower short-term profits is never an option).

It sucks; businesses like CROs probably suffer the worst, and the soonest, since they rely on what's basically B2B sales for revenue, and aren't necessarily required, in the short term, for their clients to stay afloat. 

And the Fed announcing today that they still aren't going to cut rates yet will probably result in even more layoffs throughout the industry in the coming months.

If I'm right that the layoffs are primarily just a result of the high interest rates, at least that means that once they're lowered back to normal, companies will likely be rehiring a lot of the people that were laid off, and the job market in the industry will mostly revert back to normal.

Who's to say, though; corporate greed makes any shitty scenario possible.",mathnstats

Leaving 3 VMs in one day is kind of a lot, and might rub them the wrong way.

If you try to call them around 930-10am their time tomorrow, though, there's a decent chance they'll be able to answer and everything will be hunky dorey.

If they don't, try sending an email to whoever your point of contact is and see if you can set up a time for a phone call that'd work for both of you.

Try to be patient, though; it sounds like you've already got the job, they just need to make the offer, so either they'll get back to you as soon as they can, or they've already moved on and wouldn't be worth working for anyways (chances are, it's the former).

If you're *too* persistent/impatient, they might rethink their choice to hire you (I'm not saying it'd be reasonable nor likely, just that HR staff are people, too, and can be just as unreasonable as anyone else).

If it makes you feel any better, I had a similar experience with the place I currently work at; they said I'd hear from them within a day or two. I missed their call while working. Tried calling them back once or twice. They ended up not getting back to me for another day or 2, but they *did* get back to me (and even offered me 20% more than I asked for!); they were just swamped at the time.

And this is probably the best company I've ever worked at so far in my 10 year career.

Regulatory has been telling industry for years to focus on risk based quality management, the critical to quality / study endpoints data, and I have trouble imagining studies with that many checks outside the system for review on the critical data. If you have to review that much, of course things are going to get missed, and it is much more likely that something important will be. This was a topic at the regulatory townhall at SCDM last year.

I found out last year that for one of my oncology studies, the CRO had been doing manual SAE reconciliation monthly. This was a Phase 1/2 study that had been ongoing for 4 years. The DM told me it was taking the data team 24 hours each month to review, when in reality we were getting on average maybe 1 new SAE reported a month at that point.

clinicalresearch,Onsite versus remote visits,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1chkwsp/onsite_versus_remote_visits/,27,30,"I believe sponsor does not provide source worksheets in recent years due to compliance issue. CRF, eCRF, paper source document, EPIC are all in the scope of source documents in clinical trials if you look up FDA guidance. For the sake of the argument, a piece of paper or sticky note with trial information is part of source doc. When paper records were scanned into an electronic system, say EPIC, the record in EPIC becomes certified record, thus original paper copies can be disposed. For example, does your trial have lab sample acquisition forms? That is the paper source and needed to be scanned for you to monitor electronically.

For your original question, it has to be a risk based assessment. What you are able to do remotely can only be part of sponsor (or CRO delegated) oversight responsibilities. Does your trial utilize central/risk monitoring model? How do you monitor your IP accountability beyond what recorded in Vestigo? Does your trial use Class II drug which you have to conduct drug return verification, i.e. pill counts? How do you know if your drug stored properly?

Agree with you on that, remote monitoring does not mean less workload for monitoring activities.

If you keep up with current thinking or Q&A session from FDA BIMO folks via public forum, fully remote is not being endorsed but onus is on sponsor to mitigate risks. Furthermore, if you have been to a FDA inspection, this would be questioned by inspector if your monitoring plan does not support fully remote or have justification for fully or most remote visits.

I am not a US tax attorney but this is generally the process. You can find more information online or by reaching out to an approved US tax attorney.

Please keep in mind that crossing the border into the states as a Canadian is a complete different process from obtaining a US tax ID number and while most Canadians do not require a visa for up to a six month stay in the US, the border agent had ultimate authority to exclude you if they suspect that you are here to perform work for which a visa is usually required, and they’re fully within their rights to do so. 

I’ve seen a few subjects kicked out by USCIS because of dodgy incomplete paperwork, poor comprehension and explanation of what they’re doing here, and we’ve had to send letters of invitation to our partners to make everyone happy. So just be vigilant. You’re not doing anything dodgy, but the border agents tend to be very twitchy people.

When you DO get your ITIN, you provide it on a form W-8BEN to the requestor (clinical trial site). An American national doing the same process would provide their SSN on form W-9. Note: We do NOT provide our actual Social Security Number card to *anyone* for review. It’s simply a signed document that we certify under penalty of perjury.",whereami312

The only downside is really dependent on the trial itself. For one, all participation in clinical research means some loss of privacy between you and the provider (i.e you’re giving more information than is typically required during a normal visit). There are cases where people on the study side see information that they’re not supposed to (e.g. information being accidentally deidentified, etc.) but the consequences are usually very minimal (the nonredacted file gets deleted). 

If you’re going to participate in an observational type study, you have to consider the risks that go along with the methods of observation. If you don’t like needles and a study requires a weekly blood draw, that’s something you might want to consider. Additionally, some studies require frequent X-ray/radiation exposure (think of a study that measures bone density) which can very slightly increase your risk for cancer. If you’re in a study with an intervention (a pharmaceutical, etc.) there are always anticipated and unanticipated reactions that may occur. 

When you enroll in a study, the doctor or staff will give you a consent form to read over and sign if you’d like to participate. This informed consent form will provide you with all of the necessary information for you to determine if the study is a good fit for you. The form will contain all risks and benefits associated with enrolling.",Resident_Plenty6821

clinicalresearch,Entry Level CRA,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cgwk4n/entry_level_cra/,18,11,"Congrats!

Things I would have appreciated hearing when I got started as a CRA:

 - You cannot do the work of the site. Once you do, they come to expect it indefinitely from both you and their other CRAs. As a PM, you probably know that. 
- You are not responsible for the site’s actions. If the site disregarded your directions in favor of their own, it’s not your fault. Your duty is to remind them what’s expected, document the issue, and send positive energy their way whenever possible. 
- For every problem, there’s a solution. There’s nothing you’re coming across as a CRA that can’t be handled. Lean on your colleagues, LMs, and CLMs to get you on the right path. There’s no shame in not knowing how to handle broken things. Many CRAs come from sites where you followed the protocols, manuals, etc and reported everything appropriately - that’s not a typical site.  
- Don’t kill yourself for the company. They will have you flying to four cities a week, completing multiple visits a day, and even after you’ve been up until 4am completing reports ask you why you spent $2 in office supplies. Don’t ask me how I know. Take your FTO, take an extra night in a hotel if you need it, and know what inches you closer to burnout. Be open with your manager about it so they can shield you from additional obligations while you regenerate the desire to work there. 
- Stay loyal to the same brand(s). This means always renting from the same rental car company, staying in the same hotel chain, and maximizing your unreported income (loyalty programs) as much as possible. There’s something nice about bringing your parents/partner/family somewhere and having the ability to make their trip better than it’s ever been before or would have been without you. 
- Invest your or your company’s money into lounge access. You’ll spend a lot of time in an airport and having access to a standard set of snacks and drinks when you arrive ultimately saves you and your company time and money. The platinum card from American Express or the Sapphire card from Chase may be a worthy investment if you’re stateside. 
- Spend your stipend unless it comes back in cash. Even if I don’t have the will to spend the money on myself, I’ll always make sure to use that money to give food to a less fortunate soul, provide an amazing tip, or even to bring snacks back home. If you don’t spend it, it simply stays in the hands of the sponsor. 
- Buy yourself a nice set of luggage and laptop bags to make it through. You’ll be running through airports, sites, and hotels - a bag failure while you’re traveling can have some pretty detrimental effects for your day and can even leak into your visit. Some companies have stipends for this. 
- Take time during your trips for you. If you spend an entire day/night working for the man and you don’t stop to grab that overpriced coffee, dinner at that cafe you always wanted to go to, or walk around like a tourist in a cool city - you’ll become jaded like many of us here. 
- On site relations, read about what sites complain about here and really hear them out. Some CRAs have hella high expectations and some barely show up. Your job isn’t to give them the answers they want in the time they want it but instead to provide the right answers and to set expectations (for yourself and the site). 
- Harass them as little as possible and make sure they know that you believe in them. Remember, YOU are the one with the relationship with the site and the sponsor may not have your back when they say that you’re “aggressively” just doing your job. You do not deserve to be treated with indignity from the site. If something traumatic happens, you have a right to request a new site. 
- Lastly, stay organized! If you can’t give someone a rundown of your site in 3 minutes or less, it may be concerning. Work on your eTMF filings weekly, utilize your CTA, and take pride in your ability to translate from whatever-the-fuck-nonsense-query they just got from DM into language they can actually understand. 

Anyway, that’s what I would have written to myself. I hope it’s helpful.",ALCOAAAAA

I’ve only been doing it a year but I got advise from sponsor CRAs with over 20 years CRA experience and this is an echo of all they told me. Especially not doing everything for the site instead giving the site the tools to do it themselves. If I like a site or feel bad for a coordinator (high turnover terrible managers) I will help a little extra, but if a site is rude, demanding, or doesn’t give me the time of day when I try to help, I am less kind and more curt. 

However there are boundaries to helping a man in need. As soon as I help extra they take that and run with it. I’ll go to site and they think I’ll do everything for them. All I’m there to do is review their work not do it for them. So I have to correct their assumptions. I give a lot of emails ahead of visits and let them know they are responsible for xyz and it should be done prior to the visit. It helps with coordinators who actually care and are team players.

However, that being said, becoming a nurse can be brutal. Depending on how fast or slow your program is, then you potentially won’t be able to work at the same time due to school work and clinicals. Not only that but you need to factor in school loans, I’ve noticed programs like the one you’ve mentioned can be pricey. There are other routes you can take with it being cheaper…so I beg you to not take huge loans out for a program that can be done cheaper. Also, do you need the masters? 

The other thing to weigh is your mental health. If it’s taken a hit now, nursing school isn’t going to help anything, trust me.

Lastly, are you interested in bedside nursing? Just know it’s an entirely different ball game, and you don’t necessarily need it to go further in research.",miloblue12

Nursing is a hard road but also a great credential to have in your back pocket- I worked 19 yrs as an icu rn and use my nursing knowledge everyday in pharma as a clinical scientist as it helps me with med review and coding and discussing cases or writing narratives. Bedside nursing is very physical - on your feet, handling patients so tend not to retire there unless you look at other avenues/ triage nursing, etc that are not physical - if serious there are many ways to get a nursing licence- an associate degree ( cheaper) , a 1 yr bSN , don’t go into major debt for a credential - you can prob get the same bang for your buck taking a couple of courses at a pharma conference and specializing in an area - RN licensure is a long road",Interesting-Potato66

clinicalresearch,Is becoming an RN worth it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cgi7v5/is_becoming_an_rn_worth_it/,4,9,"Really depends where you see yourself working. If switching for industry, the won't help much. You can advance in clinops without it. In clindev you need terminal degree nowadays. We don't have a single nurse as clinical scientist without them having terminal degree. Mostly we have pharmd or phds, or those with masters who grandfathered due to 10-20 years of experience. 
In my old hospital, CRNs typically are paid more than CRCs, but not that much more. For ex. When I was without RN, I was making 90K, once I got my license my salary increased to 100K. But it could have increased without the licence as well, just purely from experience stand point. So if staying  within the academia or hospital setting, evaluate what you want to do in 5 years, still be coordinating or move up to management or switch to pharma. In any case, I don't think MSN will be worth unless you advance to NP down the road. But if you see yourself coordinating for the next 5-10 years, maybe it will be worth it money wise.

Perhaps your company offers a shadowing program with other roles or part-time assignments in other departments? I have done these in the past and they’re a great way to learn about different career paths in the clinical research.

If you are good in critical thinking and pay strong attention to detail, risk-based central monitoring may be a good match for you. The knowlege of site processes is a huge advantage there and I know many former site monitors who grew tired of constant travelling and were very happy once they moved to central monitoring. This position usually does not require direct contact with the sites but rather the central study team. Other roles where prior site monitoring experience may be an advantage are with site identification, biomarkers, study supplies or patient engagement teams. 

Another thing (and I’m speaking from my experience - not as a site monitor though), work for Sponsors has always been more rewarding and better organized than for any CRO I have ever worked with, especially when it comes to the workload and timelines. Look for openings at your Sponsor companies.

Or is it the typical scenario with most software, where you log in one morning and see a pop up saying version has been updated “see release notes here”? or something lol (where the customer has no control over the upgrade releases).

Respectfully, that isn’t really answering what I wanted others to share; I want to hear from other sites that use these tools what collection of documents do they produce when the auditor says “please show me your CTMS validation”. 

I think it’s awesome that you guys provide that at the time of implementation and our team really appreciates it; but it doesn’t cover the bit I’m asking about which is more concerning “what additional documentation/validations are other sites regularly creating, and responsible for providing when asked”. 

The fda guidelines are pretty fuzzy imo, and I’m trying to figure out how other clinical/site staff have chosen to interpret their obligation (in addition to what the vendor provides). Basically, is everyone else regularly validating every feature when an update is released? Keeping that documentation on hand? Every new major platform upgrade? (This is why I’m asking, because it would be additional work for the site to be responsible for doing— not just covered by a 1 time courtesy validation at time of implementation).",frufruityloops

clinicalresearch,"Site Staff: Pls help, CTMS validations",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cg5ts3/site_staff_pls_help_ctms_validations/,2,8,"Oh wow. That’s actually really intriguing! The part where you’re able to test months in advance. I think that’s a big part of why the “other” method seems weird to me. Our company/sites, we have no control over when a release occurs. Sure, plenty of software vendors love to tease upcoming new features… sometimes we see them, sometimes it takes longer. But for the actual version upgrade, we have no way to test it ahead of time and know how it’s going to work. It’s just “hey we changed stuff overnight and ta-da, it’s been upgraded!” Haha. 

Like to me, it feels like the equivalent of getting a newly approved ICF on the morning of a scheduled visit. Like, not ideal. I have to consent with the right version so I have to scramble to figure out the changes before walking into the patient room.

For sites that are using a Crio/realtime validation script they provide to internally validate the change, I’m wondering how they avoid staff using the updated version of the platform while someone is performing the validation… like, we had no control over the day it was released. If validating the change is so necessary for quality, wouldn’t it make more sense to try and say “no one use Crio/realtime this morning; we just got an upgrade and we need to validate it first” <- that’s obviously super impractical for a research site lol like I don’t think the business can afford to halt operations. But if the alternative is to let people use it still while internally validating the release like… it feels like a moot point? Your users are “validating” it at the same time, by actively using it in their visits lol. 

I realize I’m way over thinking this but gosh it just feels like adding a lot of busy work to a platform entirely outside of our control. Busy work that isn’t really going to change anything. Busy work that the vendor had already done prior to the release.

I hope more people share what they do! Thank you for mentioning oncore, I’m going to look it up! Really interesting you get to test ahead of time :)",frufruityloops

The best move is to try to attach yourself to a project getting direct VA funding through a VA Merit grant or a CSP clinical trial where you can be hired directly through the VA. 

Once you can get a GS job (most in research that are grant funded are “term”) you can pivot to other VA GS permanent research jobs. 

The key to working with the federal government is being willing to relocate. There are clinical research jobs with the VA but you have to be move to Boston, Palo Alto, DC, Baltimore, etc where the major VA research centers are.

Also to be clear while you may have the title of a CRA, you are doing study coordinator work…..that’s not a knock or a dig but you will have no easier time transitioning to traditional CRA jobs at CROs than any other research coordinator.

clinicalresearch,Regulatory Question: Can the IP used in a study be transferred to another study of the same sponsor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cfsckj/regulatory_question_can_the_ip_used_in_a_study_be/,10,19,"I am assuming you’re a sponsor by your phrasing that you have a large amount of IP at the depot. As it is today, no, you cannot transfer IP from one study and use it for another as it sits today. This is because the IP has closely regulated labels that identify the study that have to be approved by regulatory bodies and subject to audit. There are also shipment regulations to follow, especially if you’re shipping internationally. You must also assess blinding concerns, expiry, regulatory issues, etc. While marketed co-medication may be considered bulk stock, experimental treatments is not.

Here is a grossly exaggerated simplification of what you might be able to do:
- investigate the possible ability to relabel (example: a closet sachet with the label printed on couldn’t be relabeled because you’d have to open the sachet, blinding concerns on the new trial)
- if you can relabel, price and plot the relabeling efforts on a timeline. I’d predict a minimum of 3 months
- design the label
- get ethics and regulatory approval for the label
- update the IRT to make the IP indispensable on the old study
- pay for the relabeling process
- wait for the work to be done and collect all the paperwork, do all the accounting, then reprogram your IRT
- get ready to send out IP

I’d predict this to take between 3-8 months, so closely monitoring the expiration date will be vital.",Rosie-Disposition

It would depend on how soon you need it. If it’s still early in startup you may have time to relabel for resupply or new sites, but there really could be blinding issues so you’d need to make sure it’s identical in every way to any other IP being used and the depot is able to align packaging and labeling with your main drug supply for the trial. If you are aligning with a previous label that’s already designed and approved then the process will be faster than 8 months, but it can still take a month or so to wait in the labeling queue- assuming your depot has relabeling abilities in addition to shipping, they packaged and labeled your main IP for both trials, and used no custom materials that needed to be ordered or produced specially for this trial. They’d also need to work with your IRS vendor to ensure the system is reprogrammed because the original IP kit list may already  be programmed in for randomization/shipping. Best case, existing label, standard packaging in stock, all kit production and labeling was handled by the same depot for both trials and they are already the same and JUST need to be relabeled, 2-3 months I’d think.",GreenBeans23920

I did the usual HR call and then a second call with the two COL LMs in my division, that second call is where I gave a 10 min presentation.

The HR call was very standard, generalized HR questions as they went down their checklist.

The second call was the meat of the interview. My presentation went well and then they asked me a bunch of situational questions; how would you handle this, do you have experience with that, give me an example of a time when, etc.
I’d recommend reflecting on unique experiences in your career that you can reference for questions like that. They also took some time to answer my questions.

For me response time was very quick. I was given a job offer within 3 business days of my interview. Negotiation took about 48-hours, and then I signed the offer letter.

2) Like what other commenters have said, when I am asked a question I don’t know the answer to, I just say I’ll take it back to the team and mark it as a follow up item.

- If there’s another CRA performing an SIV remotely that you can attend, then sit in and see what you would mimic or change

I'd rather have you wait for the correct answer than answer you with something I am not absolutely sure about. Also, we do the same thing with y'all too.

Don’t forget, you can or have sent the presentation for everyone to read, so you don’t have to regurgitate everything on each slide. Print each page out and write the one or two things you want to point out.
The real key to presenting, and I’ve only been in the pharma industry for a half dozen years, having previously worked on the brand and advertising side, being terrible at public speaking but having to do it constantly, is to really know your material. Like, inside out. Know what’s on each slide without having to look. Consciously think about your pacing and slow down. Take a breath between points. Take a breath before moving to the next slide. Record yourself speaking and count the umms. Learn to replace each umm with a “so” and a breath.

Travel reimbursement for subjects is a huge one in my realm, and also sponsors always complain first about what we ask in our budgets for CRC time- literally devaluing us and the time we spend on their studies. 

The big one though, the one that really feels like blatant disrespect that has had me ready to leave research altogether more than once, is taking forever to answer questions that we need to have answered in order to move forward and then turning around and pestering us relentlessly- sometimes even berating us- if we let anything sit for a minute because we can’t just drop everything we’re doing and jump when the sponsor finally answers us. This occurs throughout the study, not just during startup. And we’re usually already totally over it by the time the study starts- with years ahead of dealing with this sponsor that has already ruined their relationship with us. 

I really don’t think a lot of people in industry are truly aware of the fact that site staff, especially those that are experienced and knowledgeable, are probably the scarcest of all resources in research. They are universally spread incredibly thin and are probably either burned out already or are working very hard to protect their energy (i.e. setting boundaries with demanding, unappreciative sponsors) so they don’t burn out.

There’s a huge cultural difference between industry and academia, and unfortunately there are a lot of aspects of industry culture that are totally incompatible with academia, and bridging that gap seems to fall on the site staff way too often. Some people on the industry side do get it, but there are certainly way too many who don’t.",Myrtle_Snow_

Making sure there was a firmer contact between the back of my hand holding the needle and the person’s arm made it much easier to keep the needle rock solid while swapping tubes.

If it's not practically possible to make the two treatments look the same so that it is unavoidable that the staff administering the treatment will know the treatment assignment, you need different blinded and unblinded staff. For example, if the study is comparing patients who were treated with a medical device versus people who did not receive the device, there's kind of no way for the person who's setting up the device to be blinded. Some protocols will use sham devices but that can be prohibitively expensive and complicated. Another example is meds that have to be mixed immediately before administration.

To be honest, the protocols don’t really stick until I’ve conducted a few QV/SSV/PSV or SIVs and even after that, I may misremember details when I’m on-site for IVs. That’s why, whether as a CRC or CRA, I always refer back to the protocol. I have the PDF open while on-site with my comments and highlights to make it easier to navigate. Commenters have already listed out the most important aspects of the protocol. I also highlight unique parts that may get missed (e.g. all women will have  a UPT, not just WOCBP or IP must be taken for no more than x days even though there’s a window for the EoT visit which goes beyond that).

I first thought the company's hiring methods were unorthodox and innovative, but after a too-good-to-be-true offer letter, my new 'manager' began texting me well into a Friday evening and Saturday morning in order to deposit home office funds.  I became perturbed of the intrusion and unprofessional nature. I passed this off as a neophyte manager's mistakes. 

Finally, when I was told by my new manager that these funds to purchase office equipment/electronics would be sent to the CRO's contracted vendor via CashApp or ApplePay, I immediately stopped and started questioning. To my chagrin, my new manager ghosted me. 

My initial email came from an email address with domain name @careers-ergomedcro.com .  If one refers to the legitimate company's website, the proper domain name to which one can use to inquire about the CRO is @ergomedgroup.com .",placeboduped

Previously, the company purchased the materials for our employees, but due to logistics issues and repeated errors that have been happening on the receipts of purchase from the vendor, it was decided that all newly hired employees would purchase the materials from the company's accredited vendors while the company provided the funds that would be used for the purchase. If you can work for the company for 12–16 weeks, the equipment automatically becomes yours, and your name has to be on the receipt of purchase to show that you made the order from the vendor.

clinicalresearch,Which jobs/positions are safe from outsourcing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1ccef3b/which_jobspositions_are_safe_from_outsourcing/,27,27,"On the sponsor side? I'd tend to say no. You still need someone to oversee CRO, develop SOPs, interface with leadership about DM-relevant topics, etc. That can't be easily outsourced-- different time zones with possible language barriers, etc.

Keep in mind that for biotechs, on time and high quality databases are literally life and death. Biotechs need money to survive. How do you get money from investors? You show data. How do you get data you want to show when you need to show it to investors? At least part of that is good data management. It doesn't do a biotech any good to show partially complete data the week after JPM conference. We need complete data for JPM.

For big pharms with in-house data management, maybe. I don't have any experience there so I can't speak to it.

On the CRO side, I think the same generally applies to DM leads. Sponsors will definitely push back on DM leads in different time zones with language barriers, etc. As a stats lead, I still interact with my CRO data managers a decent amount and it would be pretty dead on arrival to me to have two competing bids where one had a stats/DM team on a totally different time zone and another not. I can't speak for DM services as much, but at least for Stats services I would abso-fucking-lutely push for taking the Stats part of the scope to a niche stats-focused CRO (think Cytel, Everest, etc.) if our full service CRO was trying to give me the run around. And I would win that discussion with leadership. It's the same thing with stat services-- good stats packages are how we present data to investors and it's critical that's it's on time and done correctly. It's not worth a 200k savings if it jeopardizes that.

For positions below data managers-- the support staff inputting queries, harassing sites, programming edit checks, etc. it might be a little easier for CROs to ship that to India or wherever. It's possible. I suspect it's going to be all fun and games, until someone does it and then there's a major audit finding that delays an NDA acceptance. Word will spread relatively quickly of who's doing it and how their processes have gone to shit, and then sponsors will start awarding studies elsewhere and the pendulum will swing back the other way.

The stupidity of sponsors is greatly exaggerated. We might be unrealistic, but we aren't stupid.",Puzzleheaded_Soil275

CROs will still need a sponsor-facing DM lead that's based where the sponsor is (often North America, but non-NA sponsors also are biased towards their own localities too). It's just a fact. Anyone that would say otherwise has not sat through enough bid defenses to recognize it. 

There is a lot of support staff underneath the DM lead and that, perhaps, can be done without compromising quality. But from a business development perspective (i.e. sponsors awarding contracts) it's not only quality that matters, but the *perception* of quality that also matters. CROs moving the majority of their operations elsewhere will risk the perception that the quality is not there, regardless of whether that's legitimate or not.",Puzzleheaded_Soil275

This is not a complaint about DM, nor the sites, it sounded like they were both all for doing this, but for some reason it broke the system when I suggested to the study teams that since I don’t understand what DM wants, the site doesn’t understand what DM wants, so *maybe have DM talk directly to them*.

I have always been happy to work directly with CRAs so that they can walk the sites through the queries themselves - better the guidance come from someone the CRC already knows.

Also, once you establish a relationship, sites will call DM. In order to be effective, data reviewers need to be heads down and task focused. Dealing with constant phone calls will prevent them for doing that. The Lead DM is already in meetings all day and won't have time for talking to the sites.

I tell my teams no more than two re-queries before you reach out to the CRA, and if they think the issue warrants it they don't have to re-query at all before reaching out to the CRA.

I was shocked, because most of my “real” CRA friends have nearly nothing going on with linked in. If anything, that’s the easiest thing to fake if I wanted to lie about being a CRA.

clinicalresearch,ICON project analyst mass layoffs ,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cbfbfb/icon_project_analyst_mass_layoffs/,9,2,"I was in a similar situation as you, as I was initially brought onto icon for the CRA bridge program. The initial program should’ve only been six months until transitioning into a CRA one from an in-house CRA. I was approached by another company for a CRA position amidst also being approached by icon for a position called a project specialist. This project specialist/analyst position would be a lateral move and another training program for a program. My initial intention was to stay with icon as I too wanted to go the management route. After a month or two going back-and-forth with my icon manager of getting some ass sororities of when I would progress to a program manager, what my salary would be, what would be the roles and responsibilities… I got radio silence. Upper management never had firm details, so I ended up taking the other CRA position which was a salary increase as well. Fast forward six months and the same in-house CRA’s and project specialist have not been promoted.

I only really this to you so that you can get an understanding of my experience there. I’m not saying the icon position won’t be amazing, but I would ask more questions about the position when you would be promoted and what the pay would look like. I would also ask management if they have already progressed some of these project analyst into the program management role.

I finally ended up choosing the other CRA position because I ended up drafting up a proposal to my manager to bring to management to get more details of the project specialist position and was essentially ghosted 

Advice to you is to be thorough with your questions for icon, and if you can try to get some of these things in writing that they are proposing for you. The one thing you don’t want to do is get into a position and have no clear path For progressing.

Instead of attempting to retain me by hearing my concerns and fixing the issues; I was threatened with my non-compete. That if I left the company for another CRO I would be someone they pursue. 

After sticking it out for a while things have gotten better. The pay is more competitive, extremely so when you factor in all the bonuses. Just not a cohesive work in environment. Middle management to upper-middle are out of touch and tone deaf which makes day to day operations difficult. CRAs are trained to have a variety of abilities and be very hands on with other departments so much so that the supporting departments desperately lack in their own duties.

clinicalresearch,FTC Announces Rule Banning Noncompetes,https://i.redd.it/uxvcmyoz6awc1.jpeg,260,72,"Medpace has only one value proposition.. they give you free CRA training and have a good training program for it. They weed out people who fail at the mock trials but if you make it through, you will be a good CRA. Online CRA programs are good and all but not standardized so you may work for a CRO where many people have been trained in different ways.

Medpace standardizes it but pays you like dogshit. I made 40k as an entry level CRA. Their non compete is for 1 year and they prevent you for working for another CRO. So basically you can’t jump ship to get paid a lot more at another CRO. They aggressively try to find out where you’re going and will take legal action if they find out you breach the non compete. 

This is why everyone is saying fuck Medpace because if this holds up, they are going to be forced to pay their CRAs more because now we have leverage to just leave with no consequence. They will have to pay up to retain their staff",Saucypants108

clinicalresearch,Feedback on Actalent,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cb78bi/feedback_on_actalent/,4,8,"I was the first CRC to come onto my current workplace with Actalent. They were completely disorganized, my manager was an idiot who repeatedly fed me the wrong information about my job and the stuff I needed to get started. They refused to pay for holidays that Actalent didn’t recognize but for which my hospital was closed (MLK, Juneteenth).

I came on for a one-year contract with the expectation that if the hospital wanted to bring me on, they could. Management came about 7 months in to learn what in the heck we all did because they had no earthly idea. They took us out to dinner and gave us a sales pitch on why we should stay with Actalent long-term.

Then, in the 9th month, they randomly extended my contract without telling me. I had screenshots of the original date in their app because I had sinking feeling they’d try something like this. I raised hell, got both my site and Actalent managers involved, and got the contract changed back. I expressed my dissatisfaction with Actalent and they didn’t really have much in the way of an argument in favor of them.

My contract ended on 10/4 of last year because I fought to get it back to its original 1 year, and I was hired full-time by the hospital on 10/5 (as was planned). I got a roughly $10k raise when I transitioned. On 10/15, my hospital initiated a hiring freeze that’s still in effect and terminated all employment agency contracts and all temp employees were laid off a month later (not Actalent’s fault, but a reminder of how fragile contract work is). In essence, I missed being part of that layoff by less than 2 weeks.

Moral of the story: I had a bad experience with Actalent. Others may have done better, so hopefully lots of people chime in, but I personally do not recommend them. Try to find a role without them if you can, and if you do pursue contract work in an entry-level role, look for agencies that don’t make you sign one-year contracts.",HinsdaleCounty

A couple of pieces of advice that I've learned from my partner being an independent contractor that may or may not be relevant to you, but might at least be worth exploring:

1) Hire an accountant. This is big. They can save you *a lot* of time and money!

2) Start an LLC for yourself (unless your accountant advises differently). It'll help with taxes and insulate you from potential liability issues. You can often also get better credit cards and loans as an LLC than you would otherwise.

3) Keep your business and personal expenses as separate as possible. Having a business credit card through the LLC can help a lot with that. Just make sure to *never* out personal expenses on the business card (though, depending on how your LLC is setup, you may be able to use the card to pay yourself in the event that your contract expires or is cancelled; talk to your accountant about that).

4) Put damn near everything necessary to work on the business CC; whether it's gas to travel to an office, coffee, cost of a co-working space if you work remote and enjoy those, high-speed internet if you work from home a lot, lunch, a laptop, a desk, health insurance, whatever. You can write *a lot* of stuff off on your taxes, to the point that you can often end up paying less in taxes than you would as a regular employee. Your accountant should be able to help you figure out everything you can count as a business expense.

5) If you can, try to ensure there's something included in your contract(s) that gives you some type of cushion/severance in the event of it being cancelled early; maybe 1 month's worth of full-time wages if your client elects to cancel the contract early. This can be difficult to negotiate and a bit risky, since a lot of companies have standard contracts they want you to sign, so carefully weigh how important that security is to you vs the risk of them saying ""nevermind, we'll hire someone else"" and not having other potential clients available.

6) If you can, try to ensure that either overtime is included in the contract or you have a hard-cap at 40 hours of work each week. Again, though, contract negotiations can be difficult/risky, so weigh the importance of this vs the risk.

7) Bill them for *every last second* that you spend working; don't let them talk you into doing *anything* ""off the clock"" or ""as a favor"".

8) Always keep in mind that you are *not* an employee; you aren't obligated to do anything that's not outlined in your contract that you don't want to do. If your contract doesn't specify joining daily meetings, for example, they cannot make you join daily meetings.

The biggest reason for using paper is that it's free. Because the log captures tasks delegated, and PI sign off, this is a high risk document. An electronic delegation log would need to be fully validated, which can be expensive, especially if the product charges per site. 

Wet ink delegation logs can also be used a a signature log if set up correctly, so you can check who signed what (lab reports, etc) so if you replace a delegation log like that, you then need to set up an equivalent signature log.

clinicalresearch,CRA 1 to SSU Specialist?,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cafiid/cra_1_to_ssu_specialist/,3,2,"I was a CRA for 6 months and switched to SSU. Reason being can't handle the travel and some sites' coordinators are absolutely lazy f\*\*k. I was a CTA for 3 years so I had SSU experience already and it was an easy switch. SSU is mostly about collecting regulatory documents (1572, IRB approval, CVs, etc.), help the site to customize informed consent, and negotiate budget/CTA. Contract specialist is the one to negotiate CTA/budget so you probably don't need to worry about that.

My advice would be get good at organizing documents & site communications, and track each site's status. If your organization skill is good, SSU for the most part is very easy work. But when the planned activation date is near, the study team will be all over you and it will be super stressful since SSU is all about meeting that activation deadline. The best part about SSU is that you can actually get the work done and move on. We activate the site and hand over to the CRAs. I aint worrying about the site after they get activated.",Ball_ChinnedKid
clinicalresearch,CRA 1 to SSU Specialist?,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cafiid/cra_1_to_ssu_specialist/,3,2,"Used to hire for SSU, also FSP. And yeah, we'd sometimes get CRA transfers. The other commenter gave a pretty spot-on explanation (for North America; responsibilities can differ a bit in other countries). 


Best advice is that you try internally first, and be sure to highlight your transferable skills, such as dealing with sites, any document collection you did, TMF/CTMS stuff, quality checking things. If you love activation and reg, that's good, highlight it. 


Our main concern with CRAs was generally that they really understand that they're trading some of their high pay for no travel. As long as this is understood and accepted, no problem. However, at CRA 1 level the difference is generally not big (or sometimes no difference).",piratesushi
clinicalresearch,I have a collegue that keeps critisizing my work based on made up procedures,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cad3dl/i_have_a_collegue_that_keeps_critisizing_my_work/,3,2,"Are you the same person who recently asked about a colleague making up regulatory requirements?


Anyway, I would not email the manager and CC that colleague. That's just asking for drama. I'd go for MS Teams message (or if you don't normally message your manager, then email the manager only) and frame it as: can you help clear this up, have I been misunderstanding something? You can name the colleague who has been telling you this, but really keep it very neutral, not accusatory or negative about the colleague. You want to be very factual in an ""I want to be sure I'm doing everything correctly"" way. If your manager confirms that you're correct, you can either ask them to support you with pushung back, or go back to your colleague yourself with the conclusion and tell them to discuss with your manager. 


Edit: If you are having this problem with the same colleague on multiple topics, do the same approach again. After 2-3 times, your manager should clue in on the fact your colleague is full of sh-t and should intervene. If they don't, then you can name the pattern yourself: ""I've come to you a few times now to clarify topics where X has been giving me incorrect advice. Is there something we can do about this?""",piratesushi

When the insiders are hollowing out the company behind the scenes, while putting misleading press releases in your face to make you think all is ok— that’s a pretty BIG RED FLAG.

I think all of the telehealth companies like TDOC have recognized that just offering a Zoom for patients and doctors is not a good solution.

Hi.  
I have had trouble finding your site's content. I find that [https://www.google.com/search?q=NCT04510324+site%3Agov](https://www.google.com/search?q=NCT04510324+site%3Agov)  currently shows:

No information is available for this page.  
Learn why  
The second link indicates that the reason for the lack of info is that the page is blocked by Robots.txt, and indeed, your robots.txt file contains:Disallow: /ct2/which matches [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04510324](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04510324), and so search engines don't index it properly because you are blocking access to it.  
Also, this poor result is an improvement over the situation a few months ago, when the result was:  
Your search - NCT04510324 site:gov - did not match any documents.  
This is a very bad result. Even today,

Oddly, I also find that your website does not make a sitemap available to search engine web spiders.  
It should; see [https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) , for example.  
A proper sitemap will allow such searches to work in popular search engines.  
This is a rather new problem - a regression in functionality as a result of recent changes. For years such searches have always worked for me. Can you please address it? Please put up a standard sitemap and/or don't block access to /ct2/ URLs.  
I did find a workaround is to go to the site and search for the trial there - [https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=NCT04510324](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=NCT04510324)  but I still think this is a problem that impacts many users and should be fixed.

(This is a joke. I'm just drinking water at the moment. I will try for a light snack and then proceed from there.) 
I usually go with Belvita breakfast bars & Nature's Bakery stuff. Its easy for me to get down. For comfort I pick up mashed potatoes, applesauce, and crackers. I avoid all dairy and meat. They're harder to digest. Having ginger helps some people. Ginger tea. The old standby that doctors recommend is the BRATT diet. 
Bananas
Rice
Applesauce
Toast 
Tea 
But I don't suggest tea if you don't need it. Ginger tea is fine, but any main tea with caffeine could contribute to water loss. And we NEED to stay hydrated. This is very much like when I was pregnant. I kept some crackers by my bed and didn't leave my bed until I ate at least 1 cracker. For some reason it helps. I'm usually fine and have an appetite by 5pm, but yesterday was the 2nd shot of the 1.2 and I just don't feel ready for food today. I did well yesterday. Smoothies are good but I wouldn't add and dairy or yogurt. Maybe just a banana, ice, and some other fruits. I've found chopping up a banana into small bite sizes and freezing them is good for when I don't want to eat. Rice is a quick one too. I've noticed I have to eat slowly. If I eat at a pace like those around me, I tend to feel queasy afterwards. Slow pace, chew my food, and water water water. I wanted to devour a watermelon the other day, but I had to recognize my digestive system is slowed down.🐌 Couscous is another thing I enjoy. If I don't feel good it's usually got enough flavor and it has protein. Sorry you don't feel good. I'll share my air puffs with you.",FlubberDubber930

I'm terrified of going up to 2.4  I did my first 1.2 last week and I had to have a barf bag at the ready driving home. I made it, but at the beginning it was questionable. Today I fought off the nausea, but I'm still getting some body aches and pains. It seems like having something in my stomach does help. I usually take my current favorite Nature's Bakery Banana chocolate chip bar with me to eat after my blood is drawn. That or the Nature's Bakery fig bars. Even if I only eat a little bit, I think it's better than on an empty stomach. I had some Belvita breakfast bars but I only had 1 at breakfast and the 2nd at lunch and then 30 min later did my shot. I was being cautious so I wouldn't get sick. Last time I felt pain wash over my left ankle as soon as I administered the shot. I hope it continues to get easier. I inject in my thigh, which I think is best for me. I take the pepcid before my shot every time. I get reflux with each dose increase. It usually goes away after 36hrs. I started taking the medicine the first week of March. I was ""screened"" at the end of February. I think I'm 4 wks behind you. Great job on the weight loss!

Have you tried taking an antacid? Usually on shot day I take some Pepcid. If it's only happening when you're lying down, it definitely sounds like reflux. 
Sorry, I shouldn't act like I know about what you're going through. My advice comes from having Irritable Bowel Syndrome and GERD (reflux) for over 20 years. I actually had what's called a ph study done before I started the trial. I was waking up with what felt like vomit in my throat. I'm a side and stomach sleeper. I'm sharing what my doctor told me. When you're lying down, the acid can come back up. The best thing for acid is laying on your left side with extra pillows, or your bed raised a bed. I ordered a wedge pillow off of Amazon, and it's really helped when my reflux is bad. I'm against PPIs like prilosec because studies have shown that long-term effects can mess with your bones. Anyway, the rules for reflux are to avoid spicy foods, don't eat 3 hours before bed, and recline your bed. If your doctor says it's OK, I'd use Pepcid. You can get 10 or 20mg. You take it every 12 hours. My study doctor and nurse have told me reflux is a listed (known) side effect. It may be messing with your stomach. If you feel sick all the time, it could just be the medicine. An antacid could help, but you may need to speak to them and explain the nausea. They may be able to give you something for it. I hope you feel better.❤️‍🩹",FlubberDubber930

I think for this trial, they probably just dosed patients at the final dosage level (so no priming period at lower doses like we are going through). So for example, participants in the 3.6 mg arm of the study immediately got a 3.6 mg injection on the first day (Week 0).

The common issue with this for all of the GLP-1RA agonists is the side effects (nausea, vomiting, bowel distress, etc...), which is the reasoning for the long dose-escalation schedule that we have for the SYNCHRONIZE trials. Because they find that priming patients at lower doses and titrating up reduces the incidence of adverse events.",alivch3

I’ve been seeing a lot of ads for under desk treadmills. They look small enough to tuck away. My only thing is to be so cute and small most of them don’t have a handle bar and I know I would need that just to catch my balance when I walk as sometimes I walk like a drunk 🤣. Or if the run have the incline they’re a little bit bigger than I’d like. But god knows it’s gonna be too hot in Florida soon that I’m gonna need something for indoors. But that did just make me think I should get Supernatural up and running again on my meta quest. If you’ve never played that it’s super fun and will quickly have you pouring sweat. Way better than going to a gym. For cardio at least.,Lucees-notforevery1

I’m happy to say I am definitely not on placebo. The problem I am having is that physically, I feel extremely full, even after what I consider a small meal (~400 calories). But mentally, I am still wanting to eat, if that makes sense. So the only thing preventing me from over eating is knowing the physical pain I will endure, but I’m still thinking about food constantly. I’m hoping at the higher doses, it will also mentally suppress my appetite. Let’s see!",alivch3

And of course as I’ve done after each visit I stop and pick up food because I’m tired from fasting till 3 pm and driving for 5 hours round trip. Big mistake. I thought “it’s been at least 4 months since you’ve had McDonald’s, let’s  give it a try”. I had two little cheeseburgers and a medium fry and I won’t be doing that again. My stomach feels horrible. Not nauseous, just kinda hurts. I should have quit at 1 burger. The fries were crap anyway. Another lesson learned. But to date I’m down 21 lbs.

I know my body so I could feel the medicine going into my system. I usually have soreness at the injection site, some slight body aches & a slight headache. I see food and have no interest in it. I now like lettuce and fresh fruit. I avoid dairy and switched to Oat Milk. My appetite has plummeted. If I don't eat soon enough I feel weak and unwell. I try to eat 3 meals a day, but sometimes I just can't eat. The week before I started the trial I was going through a rough time. I remember eating 2 ½ fresh donuts and hating myself afterwards. I felt like I ate so much sugar and fat. If you had told me that a week from that day, I would no longer crave junk, I wouldn't have believed you. I don't eat anything fried. I'm not craving donuts. I don't crave junk food. I have been having some weak moments late at night for the past 2 days. But even if I eat, I still don't hit my calorie goal. I don't exactly feel hungry when I late night snack. So I'm kind of confused as to why I'm eating. Healthy food is very expensive. When I don't have the money to restock, I struggle to find anything appealing. 
I think for me, the cravings stopped. I felt and noticed a difference in my body. I think if you write down anything you feel for 24 hours after your injection, you may notice the side effects. Really focus on how you feel. Compare your injection day to the day before your injection. You may see a pattern of side effects. It also may be your dose isn't high enough.

When I got my 5th dose I realized 1200 would be a better as I’m not as hungry now. I do a protein shake with my iced coffee each morning at 170 calories and 30 grams of protein.

Dinner was 6 oz of Bare Chicken chunks ( 320 calories and 31g protein) and Iike 15 spears of asparagus (75 calories and 6g protein). I’ll have my weekend late night snack of a nature valley protein bar (190 calories and 10g protein) to round up my day. The bars not the best protein bar choice but it has chocolate so it cures my mild sweet tooth and gives me that last bit of protein to get me to a 100g for the day.

Cranberry Pecan Chicken Salad

If you don’t do mayo do plain Greek yogurt that’ll up the protein greatly. I do nonfat, but do full for more calories.

I was hoping that in week 5 (this week) I would see a longer effect but not the case. I definitely stop eating after a normal serving of food (new and exciting change!)
However, I have my injection on Monday and by Wednesday night I’m craving wine and sugar after dinner and through the weekend. It’s awesome to have a break from the cravings for a few days though! I’m losing weight slowly but am also trying to make very small changes so that I don’t give up. I’m not changing what I eat just how much so it stays in the calorie target. I’m adding exercise this month a little at a time because I haven’t exercised regularly for 3 years! 

Trigger warning…stop if you don’t like talking or reading about the emotional side of weight loss. 



Because we have a year to make changes my decision is to keep the changes small over a month rather than implementing every recommendation in months one and two. 
I hope that everyone here is able to work through the frustration and emotional toll that we experience daily as a noticeably overweight human being! We are bombarded with messages that being fat is shameful and a personality flaw which disregards the neuroscience related to a Western diet (sugar is in every thing…seriously) and just because 60% of Americans have a ‘normal’ BMI our 40% have done something wrong. If 40% of any population has a similar characteristic in any study it’s statistically significant! 
Some of what we face is this shame. I’m sending all of you a message of absolute love regardless of the outcome, I am sending a sincere wish that we all find a way to release the guilt and shame and just do what we need to be healthy and live a long active life , regardless of our waist measurements. 
I have been listening to podcasts about weight loss and focusing on the messages behind the statement. I have found only ONE podcast episode that even mentioned the current culture of shaming others for being overweight. All the other podcasts have the same underlying message: calories in calories out, not so hard fatty.  

I also heard someone online who lost a lot of weight and is now a bodybuilder say that he has interrupted other gym rats who bash overweight people with this unhealthy message and compare the experience of calorie reduction to the practice of restricted eating to “make weight” before a competition. He asks them to remember how much they wanted to eat food, how distracting it was, and how much they ate after the competition…then said, “If you think that you can face that every day for more than 3 months, you are out of your mind.” 
This resonated with me because in the past that 3 month mark was when I seem to fall apart and eventually just give in to my cravings.  
All this is said to remind us all that we are on a different path this time. But not a fast fix.

I have not felt any appetite suppression or craving reductions. The first shot I had some burping and once have woken up in the middle of the night with very mild acid reflux.

I tried Mounjaro in late 2022 but had TERRIBLE side effects (extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting) so I only lasted 3 weeks.

How long ago did you start the crestor? If you didn’t have those side effects before the shot I would think they would be from the shot and not crestor! Unless you started both today then who knows haha.",erinmarier
survodutide,1st Shot,https://www.reddit.com/r/survodutide/comments/1b7ir42/1st_shot/,3,20,"I found this section of an article very interesting.  It talks about the GLP-1 levels in different groups of people:

Different physiological levels of GLP-1

GLP-1 circulates at low concentrations in the blood, typically in the range of 0.9-18 pmol/L? Since the levels of GLP-1 in healthy individuals are low, there is a strong need for sensitive methods to accurately detect GLP-1 as a biomarker in human plasma, with a starting point below 1 pmol/L.

In certain patient groups, GLP-1 is present in abnormal concentrations. Patients which have undergone bariatric surgery show highly increased levels of GLP-1 after a meal; concentrations up to 300 pmol/L have been reported2526, Considering the unquestionable effect of bariatric surgery on GLP-1 levels in these individuals, combined with the fact that insulin levels normalize in most patients within days after surgery, long before any significant weight loss has occurred, it will be interesting to follow research in this field as more facts about GLP-1 and its actions are revealed. These findings will contribute to the understanding of how to develop better drugs for treatment of both diabetes and obesity, emphasizing the importance of accurate measurement of GLP-1.

Another patient group with reported abnormal GLP-1 levels is T2DM patients. However, the deviation, from normal levels, is far from what has been reported in the bariatric surgery patient population and not always consistent across studies. It has been suggested that it is not the fasting GLP-1 levels that differ between diabetic and normal glucose tolerant patients, but that the postprandial GLP-1 levels are significantly lower in the diabetic group 27,28. This implies that GLP-1 secretion is impaired in this group of patients.

survodutide,1st Shot,https://www.reddit.com/r/survodutide/comments/1b7ir42/1st_shot/,3,20,"I also found this info on a C Peptide lab test which determines if a patient can benefit from a GLP-1 or DPP IV inhibitors. So I wonder if it can kind of be used in reverse to see if you are doing ""too good"" in a sense you are actually already on a GLP-1. 

Here is that info as well:

Why the Test is Performed

C-peptide is measured to tell the difference between insulin the body produces and insulin that is injected into the body.

Someone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes may have their C-peptide level measured to see if their body is still producing insulin. C-peptide is also measured in case of low blood sugar to see if the person's body is producing too much insulin.

The test is also often ordered to check if certain medicines that can help the body produce more insulin, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs (GLP-1) or DPP IV inhibitors would work in an individual patient.

survodutide,1st Shot,https://www.reddit.com/r/survodutide/comments/1b7ir42/1st_shot/,3,20,"I started the Crestor last night. I didn't have any symptoms before my injection. The burning like or warm throat and left leg aching only started after the shot. I thought maybe I grabbed my leg too hard, but it's actually achy in a wider area. I didn't jab myself hard since I'm a phlebotomist, but I went quick. I love my nurse, she's so sweet. She said ""Geez I blinked, and you had it in already,"" I told her I couldn't do it slowly on myself. It's weird, I struggle to inject myself because it's not a slow entry like a phlebotomy needle. I had her demonstrate the force and we both laughed. I said that seemed way too weak. Thankfully the actual shot didn't hurt at all. I did feel this weird surge like feeling go all the way to my head. Like whatever it was, went all throughout my body. I think my right leg would be sore as wel, if it was from the Crestor. I keep telling myself to assume it's placebo until I get further along. I'm just happy it went well. My nerves were calm and I wasn't freaking out. I thought I might have a panic attack while driving there. It was rainy and I didn't feel like going.
I think the stomach injections are harder to tell as far as muscular or aching discomfort. My thigh has way more muscle and it's solid. My stomach is a flabby blob. Lol If these side effects subside and then come back again with my next injection I think I'll know more. I read about people on the other GLP1 meds feeling side effects kick in on the 2nd & 3rd day. I was in a group on FB thinking I'd start Wegovy but never got approved. I was too scared to take a compound version, so this is my first GLP1 type med. If the aching never subsides, it's probably the cholesterol medicine. Time will tell I guess.

I literally live 5 mins away from the beach and I haven’t gone in like 3 years because I am ashamed of how much weight I’ve gained. And unfortunately some of us will get the placebo. I know when I joined that I told myself that I would be really disappointed and quite frankly heartbroken if I received the placebo because I will never be able to afford the meds. But I also told myself even if I did receive the placebo at least I’m trying to make a rather drastic lifestyle change for the better. And joining the trial gives me motivation to put as much effort in as possible. Drug or no drug. Because let’s be honest we still need to put in A LOT of work. I’m on a 1200 calorie diet and working as hard as I can to get my exercise in. Which two months ago I would have laughed at that while binging and watching tv. The shots not pure magic. We have to make a lifestyle change to lose it and keep it off. This is just making it easier for us to succeed at that change.",Lucees-notforevery1

I would ask the person at the location you are doing the trial what their guidelines are for medications. 

I asked about zofran and they shared they would consult with the dr if I asked for it and felt I needed it. I take my 3rd shot tomorrow and have not needed it yet. 

From what I saw and signed there was nothing saying we could not discuss the trial :) I have been giving myself the shots, its not ad at all. When you go in for your appointment they should show you how to inject it. I would ask them to walk you through the steps then have them watch you inject it yourself so you know how to do it. 

You should also have a meeting with a dietician to review your eating habits but my big takeaway was to eat more protein to help with satiety.

All of us have had relatively mild side effects and have no idea whether we are on the real drug or the placebo so welcome to the guessing game!",erinmarier

I get my 5th dose tomorrow morning which is titrating up. I’ve really had no side effects. I actually feel better now than I did before joining the trial! Hopefully that’s not because it’s the placebo 🤣. Heartburns gone, but also try not to eat after 6:30 so that may be helping. I have had diarrhea a couple times and a couple headaches. But I actually think it’s from eating 5 day old rotisserie chicken each time. And the headaches are probably from allergies. As far as diet MyFitnessPal put me at 1410 calories (I have no idea why it’s been years since I’ve used it)and Ive just ran with that. I’m not saying I can ALWAYS stick to it but I sure am trying. I find I try to do more protein so I’ve been mixing premier protein shakes with either fruit and yogurt for a smoothie or tossing in a caramel one with cold brew each day. As far as the needle it’s so tiny and you just stick it in, there’s nothing scary about it. If you don’t sign up for the optional study (where they tell you where to stick it) then you can stick in belly, thigh or upper arm. It’s up to you, it doesn’t always have to be the same place.

Having a family member almost die 2 weeks ago hasn't helped either. In some ways, I'm frustrated that after waiting for a trial & giving so much blood, I could ultimately get saline.😂 On the other hand, I know I'm helping with scientific research. 
I can't get the app MyFitnessPal to pair my steps from Samsung Health. I also did 1 day of what I ate and it said I ate over 1,470 calories. Before, I was eating the normal 2000. Maybe I set my goal too high for weight loss, so they're saying to eat even less? 
Due to stomach issues, I can't eat popcorn and most nuts. I can't think of anything calorie free to eat. I don't know what to eat. I'm hoping my appetite will go away, but I'm also realizing it might not.
I'm sure, like many of you, we want to have success and feel better overall. Sadly, some of us will get the placebo. I wish I could get rid of the feeling I need to eat when I don't. I drink water all day & that gets boring. If I'm on the placebo, I don't know what I'll do. I've been to 4 different specialists to try to figure out why I can't lose weight. Maybe the frustration of getting the placebo will lower my appetite.😂
I have a family member's wedding to go to in May. I truly don't want to go if I'm at my current weight. I'm ashamed. I don't want to be in photos. I cry when I get into my car after seeing myself in a store mirror or reflection. I feel disgusting. Does anyone else ever feel like they're in a sort of fat suit? It's hard carrying around excess weight. It doesn't feel like me. Having 2 chins & fat just plopped onto my body. I know I'm working myself up to disappointment, but I feel like I should prepare for it. What a wonderful surprise and help it would be if I actually was able to lose some weight.

I saw a ton of specialists since I couldn't get weight off. I did fasting & phentermine a while back. That was awful. It left me with an elevated heart rate. I always seem to worry about my heart now. I get anxious palpitations now, which I never used to get. I also get them when I get my heart rate up too high. I think my problem has been eating 1 or 2 meals a day. I might need to have small things all throughout the day. 
I really felt fat today. I was uncomfortable with my appearance and just felt like I'm carrying around a fat suit. I hate being this big. Even if I do lose 2-4lbs it comes right back.
Regarding the injection, I know how to do it, but I don't know how I'll do the actually pushing in of the needle. (I work with needles.) It's different when it's your own body. I'm curious to see if they'll let us change the location. It's mentioned that the doctor may do that at some point, but maybe this company wants it done specifically in the stomach.

survodutide,How is everyone feeling?,https://www.reddit.com/r/survodutide/comments/1at8087/how_is_everyone_feeling/,3,13,"During the first month, you will be on the lowest dose of Survodutide. Because of this, you will not get much of an effect from the medicine. The dose is simply low. 

The purpose of the low dose is to slowly get your body used to the medicine and minimize side effects. 

In my opinion, the fact that you are burping demonstrates that you probably do NOT have the placebo which is great! The burping happens because of the delayed gastric emptying.

It might just be me, but the burps can also be a sign that diarrhea or nausea are coming. To combat this, I have limited the amount of sulfur-rich foods such as meat, fish, eggs, brocolli, and cabbage. You will find out what works for you since everyone is different.",GLP1Enthusiast

I have a friend who was taking Ozempic and switched to Mounjaro. Her doctor started her on 10 mg of it which gave her lots of side effects. The recommended route is to start off at a low dose and then slowly move to the next dose because side effects are no fun! You have to allow your body to get used to the medicine. :)

I took my first dose last week and also could not stop thinking about if I got the placebo because I didn’t feel any stinging or burning from the injection which I was told a lot of people feel (I inject into the stomach). But later on in the day, I was pretty tired and had some indigestion and heart burn. Had minor nausea the next day and then from day 3 on, I’ve had stomach cramps whenever I eat and get nauseous half way through and definitely curbed my hunger. I’ve been reading more about what foods to avoid while taking GLP-1s so hopefully the stomach cramping goes away. I guess having these side effects make me hopeful that I actually got the drug. 

But just to keep track of side effects and if anyone else is experiencing the same:
Bloating
Nausea (especially while eating)
Gas
Constipation/diarrhea (I’m not using the bathroom daily like I’m used to)
Stomach cramping 
Random burst of hunger for short period and then not being hungry at all

I did start googling last night and looking at my paperwork. The starting dose we are taking is .3, wegovy is .25 and mounjaro is .5. 

I tried mounjaro (October 2022) but quit after 3 weeks of horrible vomiting and nausea. I did 2.5 months of compounded sema and only ever had the lowest dose with a little bit of nausea but lots of fullness. 

Maybe this drug just has less side effects?

I do wonder that after a few months if I think I have the placebo I will want to keep going with the trial….",erinmarier

The amount of energy you get out of gluconeogenesis is probably limited. It's not clear what the limit is, however, or whether the limit is fixed. 

The body can send excess amino acids into gluconeogenesis or it can burn them directly in the Kreb's cycle. Good luck figuring out how that decision is made.

People with fatty liver have broken regulation of gluconeogenesis - that's what leads to the hyperinsulinemia that characterizes insulin resistance. Different degrees of fatty liver likely have different levels of gluconeogenesis. 

People eat different levels of carbs on keto, and there's probably a genetic component as well. And different people have different levels and kinds of exercise, which influences glucose burn.

Because of all those factors I don't believe there is one answer. There are probably people where excess protein generates extra glucose, and there are probably people where it has no effect.",Triabolical_

ketoscience,Saturated fatty acids inhibit unsaturated fatty acid induced glucose uptake involving GLUT10 and aerobic glycolysis in bovine granulosa cells (2024),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59883-x,13,2,"Abstract:
>Fatty acids have been shown to modulate glucose metabolism in vitro and in vivo. However, there is still a need for substantial evidence and mechanistic understanding in many cell types whether both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (SFAs and UFAs) pose a similar effect and, if not, what determines the net effect of fatty acid mixes on glucose metabolism. In the present study, we asked these questions by treating granulosa cells (GCs) with the most abundant non-esterified fatty acid species in bovine follicular fluid. Results revealed that oleic and alpha-linolenic acids (UFAs) significantly increased glucose consumption compared to palmitic and stearic acids (SFAs). A significant increase in lactate production, extracellular acidification rate, and decreased mitochondrial activity indicate glucose channeling through aerobic glycolysis in UFA treated GCs. We show that insulin independent glucose transporter GLUT10 is essential for UFA driven glucose consumption, and the induction of AKT and ERK signaling pathways necessary for GLUT10 expression. To mimic the physiological conditions, we co-treated GCs with mixes of SFAs and UFAs. Interestingly, co-treatments abolished the UFA induced glucose uptake and metabolism by inhibiting AKT and ERK phosphorylation and GLUT10 expression. These data suggest that the net effect of fatty acid induced glucose uptake in GCs is determined by SFAs under physiological conditions.",basmwklz

Here the author explains the study a little more

https://blog.maryannedemasi.com/p/new-analysis-shows-statins-have-minimal-benefits

What did our analysis find?

We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 statin trials involving 143,532 participants, using similar criteria to the CTT, and found no consistent relationship between lowering LDL-C with statins and death, heart attack or stroke. 

Statins are very effective at lowering LDL-C, but in some trials, that did not necessarily translate into a meaningful benefit for the patient. 

This contradicts the prevailing view, promoted by the CTT, that there is a strong “linear” relationship between lowering LDL-C and cardiovascular outcomes from statin therapy.

Our analysis also highlighted the significant difference in the relative risk reduction (RRR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) of statin therapy on death, heart attack and stroke.

For example, if your baseline risk of having a heart attack is 2% and taking a drug reduces that risk to 1%, then in relative terms you halved your risk (50% RRR) which sounds impressive, but in absolute terms, you have only reduced your risk by 1% (ARR).

Our analysis showed that trial participants taking a statin for an average of 4.4 years, showed a 29% RRR in heart attacks, but the ARR was only 1.3%.

>DHA is abundant in brain where it regulates cell survival, neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. DHA can be obtained from the diet or synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) via a series of desaturation and elongation reactions occurring in the liver. Tracer studies suggest that dietary DHA can downregulate its own synthesis, but the mechanism remains undetermined and is the primary objective of this paper. First, we show by tracing 13C content (δ13C) of DHA via compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA), that following low dietary DHA, the brain receives DHA synthesized from ALA. We then show that dietary DHA increases mouse liver and serum EPA, which is dependant on ALA. Furthermore, by CSIA we demonstrate that the source of increased EPA is slowed EPA metabolism, not increased DHA retroconversion as previously assumed. DHA feeding alone or with ALA lowered liver elongation of very long-chain (ELOVL2, EPA elongation) enzyme activity despite no change in protein content. To further evaluate the role of ELOVL2, a liver-specific Elovl2 knockout was generated showing that DHA feeding in the presence or absence of a functional liver ELOVL2 yields similar results. An enzyme competition assay for EPA elongation suggests both uncompetitive and non-competitive inhibition by DHA depending on DHA levels. To translate our findings, we show that DHA supplementation in men and women increases EPA levels in a manner dependent on a SNP (rs953413) in the ELOVL2 gene. In conclusion, we identify a novel feedback inhibition pathway where dietary DHA downregulates its liver synthesis by inhibiting EPA elongation.",basmwklz

It is well observed that ketone production is not a hallmark of ketone usage. It's why we tell people that using urine ketone strips are useless - just because you make them doesn't mean your body is using them. In fact, usually quite the opposite. And the longer one stays in ketosis (6-18 months) the more adept one becomes at utilizing ketones, so even with a blood ketone reader these measured levels may stay lower than someone who is putting their body through a ketotic state for the adaptation phase.

To then suggest that there is no benefit to ketone usage during what is effectively the adaptation phase on heart failure is pretty rich, considering they had no subjects that were already fully adapted after the LAD procedure had taken place to compare it to.

I guess the conclusion here might better be shown to be that if you start a mouse on a keto diet post heart failure, it will likely be too late for some folks since there's no measured difference in the first 3 weeks.

Edit: moreover, this may be used as a justification to scare patients away from trying a keto diet as a last ditch effort, a la ""studies show it won't even do anything for you, there was no difference once the heart disease was present.""

**Background**

p66Shc, as a redox enzyme, regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria and autophagy. However, the mechanisms by which p66Shc affects autophagosome formation are not fully understood.

**Methods**

p66Shc expression and its location in the trophoblast cells were detected in vivo and in vitro. Small hairpin RNAs or CRISPR/Cas9, RNA sequencing, and confocal laser scanning microscope were used to clarify p66Shc’s role in regulating autophagic flux and STING activation. In addition, p66Shc affects mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) formation were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mitochondrial function was evaluated by detected cytoplastic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).

**Results**

High glucose induces the expression and mitochondrial translocation of p66Shc, which promotes MAMs formation and stimulates PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy. Moreover, mitochondrial localized p66Shc reduces MMP and triggers cytosolic mtDNA release, thus activates cGAS/STING signaling and ultimately leads to enhanced autophagy and cellular senescence. Specially, we found p66Shc is required for the interaction between STING and LC3II, as well as between STING and ATG5, thereby regulates cGAS/STING-mediated autophagy. We also identified hundreds of genes associated several biological processes including aging are co-regulated by p66Shc and ATG5, deletion either of which results in diminished cellular senescence.

**Conclusion**

p66Shc is not only implicated in the initiation of autophagy by promoting MAMs formation, but also helps stabilizing active autophagic flux by activating cGAS/STING pathway in trophoblast.",basmwklz

Damaged cells release cytokines, which stimulate VLDL secretion. They also cause LDL receptor upregulation, so LDL uptake will be greater for membrane repair. However I do not see why would they have the highest incidence, I would assume that impaired LDL uptake and membrane repair would be worse. Or alternatively something takes up VLDL, and there will be less LDL remaining for membrane repair.",FrigoCoder

What their actually saying is LDL C levels are irrelevant but a high VLDL level is associated with a higher risk of ASCVD.  Find it strange why they never mention the Triglycerides levels being above 80 being strongly associated with ASCVD. 

As is a high Triglycerides along with a low HDL level. A Triglycerides/HDL Ratio (mg/dL units) below 1 is also associated with lower incidence of ASCVD events.

This low incidence of ASCVD events associated with a Triglycerides/HDL Ratio less than 1,  closely corresponds to a VLDL value of less than 14!",DoubtfulDomimic

This is in vitro research.

-> The extracellular matrix is important in signaling the behavior of the cell

-> KB catabolism is activated in CS cells **under nutrition-deprivation conditions**

Those are not the same conditions as in vivo.  What BDH and OXCT do together is convert beta-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) into acetyl-coa.  Acetyl-coa can only produce ATP in the CTA cycle.   So these are cells that contain intact mitochondrial cristae.

And/or the generation of acetyl-coa can be used to synthesize acyl-coa or in other words, fatty acids which can be used for cellular construction.  For cell proliferation you need not just energy but also construct cell material out of fats and proteins to form nuclei, DNA, cell wall, organelles etc..

How I interpret this is that the cells are grown under poor conditions which impairs their growth rate.  Adding any missing source of carbon or amino acids will assist in speeding up the growth.

If I'm not interpreting it wrong, you can see in [figure 1F](https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016109#Fig1) of the following [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016109) the relative reduction in growth.

The paper does not clarify which nutrients are deprived so we can't know for sure.  We do see the pathway in the following paper how serum starvation itself stimulates OXCT1 transcription.

https://preview.redd.it/p2rj989i8uwc1.png?width=3977&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b57e33d55a72825b415ede90a5bd776ea7e4b18

[https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/22/4932](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/22/4932)

Under normal conditions they add 10% bovine serum.  For the starvation they leave this out.  They added L and R-beta-hydroxybutyrate at 10mM and 25mM.  In fact it is a bit confusing.  They point to R in the title but in section 2.1 they say L-(R)-

-> the concentration is very high.  This may reflect better the conditions under ketoacidosis than under nutritional ketosis

-> They used both [L and R](https://socratic.org/questions/what-do-l-d-r-and-s-in-enantiomers-stand-for) form.  Our bodies naturally produce the L (or D) form.  We don't know here how much of the effect is due to L or R.

To further attest the importance of the starvation and concentration, the paper itself mentions the following:

>It is important to mention that the induction of proliferation was β-HB concentration-dependent in SW 1353 cells under starvation conditions because, **at 1 and 2.5 mM, the proliferation index did not differ significantly from the starvation group** (Fig. S1).

Figure 1A confirms my info above, the starvation greatly reduces the proliferation and the addition of 10 or 25mM only partially corrects the normal proliferation rate under starvation conditions.  And as the quote shows, under normal nutritional 3HB concentration it does not support proliferation.

Important, that lack of effect at 1 and 2.5 mM could be partially because of the L and R mixed form.  Somewhere between 2.5 and 10 mM there must be a change in effect.",Ricosss

Ketolysis in cancer cells isn't necessarily used for ATP.  Proliferation requires material.  Cancer cells can also utilize glucose to produce fatty acids via acetyl-coa overproduction.  Using 3HB to produce fatty acids then saves glucose for ATP production.

There are also multiple mitochondria in a cell so there could be a situation where there is partly normal mitochondria and partially supporting cancer.  

We always need to be careful with the cell line because abnormalities could become part of immortalized cell lines for research.

When it is in vitro cancer research, it's interesting read but I wouldn't hold my breath over it.",Ricosss

I looked at the protocol for when the supplementation took place and when the blood sample was taken.  All they clarify is that ketones were measured by finger prick after 10 minutes of seated rest.  The supplement was taken 15 minutes before the running started.  They don't clearly state how much time there was between supplementation and measurement although you could guess it would be 10 minutes but it would really just be a guess.

However, I do not like their responses as they are all praising the claim made that high ldl-c with low vldl-c convers the longest survival.

This does not mean anything in relation to the effects that we see on a ketogenic diet.

1. The group with High LDL-C, low VLDL-C has an average LDL-C of 123 mg/dL.  This is far from the levels that we see in LMHR's where we see values double and more compared to this group.
2. In support of the first point, if you look at the number of people within this group then we find that almost 50% of the total is within this group.  So in effect it is more representative of the average population.
3. Because of point 2, we have to consider that the other 3 groups are deviations from the average and therefor may represent a larger proportion of people with medical issues.  The low levels of LDL-C of 83.4 and 77.8 in the groups Low LDL-C, low VLDL-C and low LDL-C and high VLDL-C are, to my view, representing groups that are receiving medical treatment at a higher proportion.
4. There is a u-shaped correlation with all cause mortality in the population on a standard diet of which the reported LDL-C levels are near what the following study reported [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209592732300347X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209592732300347X)

If we hail the results then we aught to apply the findings straight onto the population following a ketogenic diet. This would mean that we have to recognize this u-shaped curve and consider levels of 200 and above equally or more at risk of all-cause mortality.

Clearly, the chosen cut-off points for the groups already influences the results.  Create different criteria and you'll find the numbers shift unsurprisingly.  What is perhaps most important in this study is the rationale for these groups.

>The study cohort was categorized into concordant and discordant pairs using clinically standard optimal levels: <100 mg/dL for LDL‐C and <30 mg/dL for VLDL‐C.[^(7)](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.123.031878#jah39411-bib-0007)^(,) [^(8)](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.123.031878#jah39411-bib-0008)

So what is really meaningful is that those who achieve this definition are not the ones who have the best outcomes.  That is for me the only hard conclusion that can be made.

As such, I find the results intriguing and interesting but non-conclusive on any benign or protective effect on a ketogenic diet.",Ricosss

It's nothing groundbreaking here or anything but even if the ""high LDL, low VLDL"" group is really just the healthier side of average, it still demonstrates the known problems with the opposite - actual low LDL (perhaps playing a role in cancer, infection, etc) and actual high VLDL (a glaring sign of metabolic problems)

EDIT: I'll add that I suspect the biggest problem with low LDL-C is that many people obtain these 60-80ish LDL numbers through regular excessive consumption of seed oils/PUFAs, and so the low LDL values really just reflect increasing susceptibility to oxidative stress.

If you look at the low LDL-C groups, they have 32.4% and 53.1% lipid lowering therapy, compared to 17.7% for the biggest group.  So due to the lipid lowering therapy, those that would otherwise fall into the high LDL-C category are now moved into the low category.  This means we're comparing apples with oranges.

One other factor for survival is the age.  The older you are, the more likely you'll suffer harder and risk death in case of an event.  We see that the high LDL-C, low VLDL-C has the lowest percentage in the age group 70 and upwards.  So just based on age itself, you'd expect this group to do better.",Ricosss

ketoscience,Seasonality in regional brain glucose metabolism (2024),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38634486/,6,2,"Abstract:

**Background**: Daylength and the rates of changes in daylength have been associated with seasonal fluctuations in psychiatric symptoms and in cognition and mood in healthy adults. However, variations in human brain glucose metabolism in concordance with seasonal changes remain under explored.

**Methods**: In this cross-sectional study, we examined seasonal effects on brain glucose metabolism, which we measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in 97 healthy participants. To maximize the sensitivity of regional effects, we computed relative metabolic measures by normalizing the regional measures to white matter metabolism. Additionally, we explored the role of rest-activity rhythms/sleep-wake activity measured with actigraphy in the seasonal variations of regional brain metabolic activity.

**Results**: We found that seasonal variations of cerebral glucose metabolism differed across brain regions. Glucose metabolism in prefrontal regions increased with longer daylength and with greater day-to-day increases in daylength. The cuneus and olfactory bulb had the maximum and minimum metabolic values around the summer and winter solstice respectively (positively associated with daylength), whereas the temporal lobe, brainstem, and postcentral cortex showed maximum and minimum metabolic values around the spring and autumn equinoxes, respectively (positively associated with faster daylength gain). Longer daylength was associated with greater amplitude and robustness of diurnal activity rhythms suggesting circadian involvement.

**Conclusions**: The current findings advance our knowledge of seasonal patterns in a key indicator of brain function relevant for mood and cognition. These data could inform treatment interventions for psychiatric symptoms that peak at specific times of the year.

>Background: A major risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders is old age. Nutritional interventions that delay aging, such as calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF), as well as pharmaceuticals that affect the pathways linking nutrition and aging processes, have been developed in recent decades and have been shown to alleviate the effects of aging on the brain. Summary: CR is accomplished by alternating periods of ad libitum feeding and fasting. In animal models, IF has been shown to increase lifespan and slow the progression and severity of age-related pathologies such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. According to recent research, dietary changes can help older people with dementia retain brain function. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of IF on the aging brain and related questions in this area of study (i.e., the potential of IF to treat neurodegenerative disorders) remain to be examined. Key Messages: This review addresses the hypothesis that IF may have translational potential in protecting the aged brain while summarizing the research supporting the putative neuroprotective mechanisms of IF in animal models. Additionally, given the emerging understanding of the connection between aging and dementia, our investigations may offer a fresh perspective on the use of dietary interventions for enhancing brain function and preventing dementia in elderly individuals. Finally, the absence of guidelines regarding the application of IF in patients hampers its broad utilization in clinical practice, and further studies are needed to improve our knowledge of the long-term effects of IF on dementia before it can be widely prescribed. In conclusion, IF may be an ancillary intervention for preserving memory and cognition in elderly individuals.",basmwklz
ketoscience,Editorial: Ketone bodies: friend or foe? (2024),https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2024.1400206/full,4,1,">The therapeutic utilization of ketone bodies (KBs), induced through ketogenic diets (KDs)—high-fat, very low-carbohydrate regimens—has a history spanning over seven decades. This dietary approach has proven beneficial for individuals suffering from intractable epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, and cancer, owing to the significant enhancements in KB levels KDs facilitate. Ketone bodies, including acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetate, play a crucial role during states of starvation, low insulin signaling, and increased availability of fatty acids, thereby emerging as central to various therapeutic strategies. Despite their broad application, KDs association with increased health span and life span in mice (1, 2), anti-inflammatory effects on the gut (3), and the ongoing efforts to expand their use, especially in cardiology, recent studies have raised concerns about the potential off-target effects of KBs. Notably, preclinical animal model evidence points towards a diametrical impact of KBs on cardiac health (4–8), and their FA composition might also be crucial in a preclinical model of psoriasis (9). However, when carefully formulated, KDs have been evaluated as safe in children to manage epilepsy concerning cardiac parameters (10, 11). Similarly, another human KD study showed favorable outcomes for cardiovascular diseases (12), suggesting that the high ketogenic ratios and the limited variety in fat intake used in rodent preclinical models might not directly translate to human applications and a nuanced perspective is essential. This is in line with a meta-study indicating increased mortality when carbohydrates are replaced with animal-derived fats and proteins (13) underscoring the importance of careful consideration of the KD’s fat composition and duration, balancing the potential benefits against possible long-term health risks. Within this Research Topic, we collected one review article and 4 original research articles to set a starting point for future Research Topics.

>In the concise review by Andersen et al., the authors elucidate the significant impact of dietary interventions, such as fasting and KD, on health, emphasizing the pivotal role of KBs—particularly beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)—in the regulation of stem cell biology. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is characterized not solely as an energy substrate during periods of fasting or adherence to low-carbohydrate diets but also as a critical signaling molecule that influences key stem cell functions, including quiescence, differentiation, and subsequent tissue regeneration. The review details how the response to KBs varies among different stem cell types, with muscle satellite cells entering a state of pronounced quiescence that limits regeneration, while intestinal stem cells see a delay in differentiation that promotes tissue regeneration due to KB supplementation.

>Buchholz et al. present a pioneering phase I/II randomized clinical trial on the feasibility and efficacy of the Modified Atkins Diet (a less stringent form of KD) in managing mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer’s Disease. Their findings suggest that even trace amounts of ketones could enhance memory and vitality, marking a significant stride toward understanding dietary interventions in neurodegenerative conditions.

>Dickens et al.’s study on adults with super-refractory status epilepticus undergoing a KD reveals intriguing correlations between increased KB production, alterations in lipid and inflammatory profiles, and clinical outcomes. This study not only adds to the growing body of evidence supporting KD’s benefits beyond epilepsy treatment but also opens new avenues for understanding the diet’s impact on inflammation and lipid metabolism.

>Xie et al. delve into the complexities of hyperinsulinemia’s effects on the metabolic switch to KB utilization in proximal renal tubular epithelial cells, offering invaluable insights into potential therapeutic targets for renal protection under energy-deprived conditions. Their work highlights the delicate interplay between metabolic pathways in the face of hyperinsulinemia and starvation, pointing to the SIRT3/SMCT1 pathway as a critical regulator of KB absorption and utilization.

>Finally, Diao et al.’s comprehensive analysis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) underscores the pivotal role of KB metabolism in the disease’s progression. By identifying novel molecular signatures, their research paves the way for targeted therapeutic strategies that could mitigate DKD’s advancement, offering hope for those grappling with this condition.

>As we conclude this editorial, it is clear that the contributions within this Research Topic not only illuminate the diverse roles of KB in health and disease but also underscore the burgeoning potential of KDs and KB supplementation in therapeutic settings. From regenerative medicine to neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, and beyond, the Research Topic navigates the complex landscape of KBs, offering fresh perspectives and beckoning further exploration into their therapeutic implications. This Research Topic serves as a beacon for future research, guiding us toward a more nuanced understanding of KBs and their place in medicine.",basmwklz

>Nitric oxide (NO), produced primarily by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes, is known to influence energy metabolism by stimulating fat uptake and oxidation. The effects of NO on de novo lipogenesis, however, are less clear. Here we demonstrate that hepatic expression of eNOS is reduced following prolonged administration of a hypercaloric high-fat diet. This results in marked reduction in the amount of S-nitrosylation of liver proteins including notably Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo lipogenesis. We further show that ACC S-nitrosylation markedly increases enzymatic activity. Diminished eNOS expression and ACC S-nitrosylation may thus represent a physiological adaptation to caloric excess by constraining lipogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that S-nitrosylation of liver proteins is subject to dietary control and suggest that de novo lipogenesis is coupled to dietary and metabolic conditions through ACC S-nitrosylation.",basmwklz

First you need to drive up the ATP production and I believe this is possible when you combine MCT oil with carbs.  Problematic is that the extra ATP production comes with extra blood acidification.  There is a concomitant increase in lactate production if it is done anaerobically and an increase in CO2 if it is done in the mitochondria.  The body is not adjusted to handle the extra acidification and reaching that pH threshold will make you lower the intensity.  At least that's what I experienced.  Perhaps the drop in pH could be partially mitigated with bicarbonate ingestion but I'm just a recreational athlete so I don't bother.",Ricosss

I have close to no knowledge on this but a general principle could be that this type of cell death is wasteful.  When ketones are around, it signals a shift to energy and resource efficiency.  It is possible that in an environment that stimulates ketosis, certain cell death may be avoided and instead repaired or cell death may be handled in a different way so that the molecules are easier to repurpose.

And given that we're talking about the brain, the resulting ROS may be less than ideal in this environment.

In addition, the HT22 cells are mouse cells. I believe they have a very different repair process in balance with their different immune system.

To show some of that immune system influence:  
- In this article they talk about how the immune system (gd T cells) producing IL-17 influences anxiety in mice.  Lack of IL-17 made them less afraid of open space where they are a more easy prey for predators so the immune system here is a direct modulator of behavior.

ketoscience,Effect of a low-carbohydrate diet on pain and quality of life in female patients with lipedema: a randomized controlled trial - PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38627016/,5,2,"
Abstract

Objective: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) compared with a control diet on pain in female patients with lipedema. The secondary objectives were to compare the impact of the two diets on quality of life (QoL) and investigate potential associations of changes in pain with changes in body weight, body composition, and ketosis.

Methods: Adult female patients with lipedema and obesity were randomized to either the LCD or control diet (energy prescription: 1200 kcal/day) for 8 weeks. Body weight and body composition, pain (Brief Pain Inventory measured pain), and QoL (RAND 36-Item Health Survey [RAND-36], Impact of Weight on Quality of Life [IWQOL]-Lite, and Lymphoedema Quality of Life [LYMQOL]) were measured at baseline and at postintervention.

Results: A total of 70 female patients (age, mean [SD], 47 [11] years; BMI 37 [5] kg/m2) were included. The LCD group had greater weight loss (-2.8 kg; 95% CI: -4.1 to -1.0; p < 0.001) and larger reduction in pain now (-1.1; 95% CI: -1.9 to -0.3; p = 0.009) compared with the control group. No association was found between changes in pain now and weight loss. Both groups experienced improvements in several QoL dimensions.

Conclusions: Diet-induced weight loss in women with lipedema can improve QoL. An energy-restricted LCD seems to be superior to a standard control diet in reducing pain",Meatrition

ketoscience,How should we differentiate hypoglycaemia in non-diabetic patients? (Pub Date: 2024-04-16),https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/1c67c2a/how_should_we_differentiate_hypoglycaemia_in/,6,6,"I was experienced episodes of hypoglycemia.  I was eating roughly 4 oranges every evening.  Thinking I was doing great by eating these deliciously sweet healthy fruits.. It probably gave me a fatty liver.  As a result, going for a walk I would have a moment where I started sweating and trembling on my legs.  Similarly after a bike ride where I of course had a carby sports drink and sports bar, any activity later on would trigger a similar episode.  That was also in a period where I was into wines and drank 1 or 2 glasses.

Not a single doctor could guess that I was experiencing hypoglycemia despite clearly describing the symptoms because they saw a lean active individual.  My mom, a nurse, immediately guessed hypoglycemia by describing her the same symptoms.  She got me a glucose meter and the next moment I felt the hypoglycemia, I measured and indeed .. low blood sugar.

Since then, I condemn any external influence on our internal hormonal regulation.

- alcohol & fructose create acute insulin resistance in the liver through lipid droplet accumulation

- stimulation of cortisol through caffeine ingestion disturbs insulin regulation

- PUFA affects the cholesterol/lipid rafts in cellular membranes which affects the insulin receptors negatively

Of course it all depends on quantity and speed of absorption but cutting out these elements allows for a much better autonomous regulation.",Ricosss

ketoscience,Ketones vs Lithium,https://breckyunits.com/ketonesVsLithium.html,5,3,"So you may like to know that the receptor sites that Lithium latches onto are the same receptor site that Magnesium does. You may also like to know that Magnesium calms people down, and front I’ve seen has a more obvious effect on those struggling with mood dysregulation. I think it’s interesting that 85% of the population is deficient in magnesium, due to our dietary choices and farming practices that have lowered the nutrients in the soil (Food had much higher nutrition rates 50 years ago). I think you may also like to know that METHYLATED B-9/Folic acid is now being prescribed by some psychiatrists. Many of my PTSD, ADHD, and “moody” friends get significant benefits from Methylated B-9, especially if they are taking 100-200% (its water-soluble, so as long as you don’t exceed like 5-10x’s the RDI amount, you should be good, you’ll just pee it out). They also get significant benefits from Magnesium. Magnesium Glycinate is great because it gets inside the cells better, the Glycinate helps transport it. That form of Magnesium is also absorbed better,  less irritating to the stomach, and great for sleep. My son’s psychiatrist prescribed Methylated B-9 and then he was able to get off his psych meds. I can tell just by looking at him if he has skipped more than 2 or 3 days. It’s crazy. No side effects. Do be careful to not use more than 350 mg of Magnesium for adult women as it’s a mineral and can build up in the body and eventually reach toxic levels, much like Lithium.

I just meant that you can consume way more magnesium. Like a wider range of tolerability before anything bad. Unlike Lithium. The range of therapeutic is so much more narrow before toxicity as you know. Also Magnesium is like the third most used mineral or something. So like your body uses it for a ton of things, so I highly doubt it would mess up the Lithium. Although calcium regulation is related to bipolar or part of the proposed mechanism? And too much salt interferes with lithium (lithium salt). So can’t say as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium are all electrolytes. It might make you need less Lithium if you are taking it though. Also I think there’s another mineral that is needed to help stabilize calcium channel gates/flow. Like help regulates it. Boron? Potassium? I can’t remember. Since you’re going down the biohacking rabbit hole. Chris Palmer is doing multiple location study on mental illness with a fair percentage of them having bipolar. The results aren’t totally in. However, it seems that about 2/3rds of his patient population experiences no need for drugs or a reduced amount as long as they stay in strict ketosis.

They are giving him at least partial funding or maybe all of it because they feel it’s so important after there son’s incredible improvement when he’s exhausted all the other options and still wasn’t functional. More research is showing mental illness is related to low-level brain inflammation. Also insulin surges. So you can have good blood glucose and a good hA1C, but still have insulin surges.

>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which cannot be synthesized by animals and must be supplied from the diet, have been strongly associated with human health. However, the mechanisms for their accretion remain poorly understood. Here, we show that LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), but not its homolog LRP6, selectively transports unesterified PUFAs into a number of cell types. The LDLa ligand-binding repeats of LRP5 directly bind to PUFAs and are required and sufficient for PUFA transport. In contrast to the known PUFA transporters Mfsd2a, CD36 and FATP2, LRP5 transports unesterified PUFAs via internalization to intracellular compartments including lysosomes, and n-3 PUFAs depend on this transport mechanism to inhibit mTORC1. This LRP5-mediated PUFA transport mechanism suppresses extracellular trap formation in neutrophils and protects mice from myocardial injury during ischemia-reperfusion. Thus, this study reveals a biologically important mechanism for unesterified PUFA transport to intracellular compartments.",basmwklz

Despite the acknowledged importance of these nutrients, this review reveals a lack of comprehensive synthesis in current research, particularly regarding the broader spectrum of fatty acids and their optimal levels throughout childhood. By consolidating the existing knowledge and highlighting critical research gaps, such as the effects of fatty acid metabolism on neurodevelopmental disorders and the need for age-specific dietary guidelines, this study sets a foundation for future studies.

The overconsumption of dietary fructose has been proposed as a major culprit for the rise of many metabolic diseases in recent years, yet the relationship between a high fructose diet and neurological dysfunction remains to be explored. Although fructose metabolism mainly takes place in the liver and intestine, recent studies have shown that a hyperglycemic condition could induce fructose metabolism in the brain. Notably, microglia, which are tissue-resident macrophages (Mφs) that confer innate immunity in the brain, also express fructose transporters (GLUT5) and are capable of utilizing fructose as a carbon fuel. Together, these studies suggest the possibility that a high fructose diet can regulate the activation and inflammatory response of microglia by metabolic reprogramming, thereby altering the susceptibility of developing neurological dysfunction. In this review, the recent advances in the understanding of microglia metabolism and how it supports its functions will be summarized. The results from both in vivo and in vitro studies that have investigated the mechanistic link between fructose-induced metabolic reprogramming of microglia and its function will then be reviewed. Finally, areas of controversies and their associated implications, as well as directions that warrant future research will be highlighted.",basmwklz

The ability of fructose to be endogenously produced in the brain under hyperglycemic conditions, combined with its potential to promote a shift towards glycolytic metabolism and inflammatory signaling in microglia, raises concerns about its long-term effects on neuroinflammation and cognitive function. The observed upregulation of fructose metabolism genes, ROS generation, and inflammatory markers in the hippocampus of high fructose diet models highlights the need for further research to elucidate the mechanisms and consequences of fructose-induced microglial dysfunction. Addressing these challenges will require a multifaceted approach that considers the complex interplay between diet, metabolism, and immune function in the brain.

Potential interventions to mitigate the effects of high fructose consumption on microglial inflammation and brain health:

1. Dietary interventions:
   a. Reducing fructose intake
   b. Increasing consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA)
   c. Ketogenic diets or exogenous ketone supplementation (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate)
   d. Increasing intake of plant-derived polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol, curcumin, flavonoids)
   e. Increasing dietary fiber intake to promote SCFA production by gut microbiota

2. Lifestyle interventions:
   a. Regular physical exercise
   b. Intermittent fasting
   c. Sleep hygiene and maintaining a healthy circadian rhythm

3. Pharmacological interventions:
   a. Anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., minocycline)
   b. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists
   c. Melatonin supplementation: Studies have shown that melatonin doses ranging from 5-50 mg per day can exert anti-inflammatory effects, with the most commonly studied doses falling within the range of 10-30 mg per day. These doses are higher than those typically used for melatonin's sleep-promoting properties and may be effective in managing fructose-induced neuroinflammation.

4. Targeting anti-inflammatory pathways:
   a. Enhancing the effects of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-10, IL-13)
   b. Modulating NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling pathways:
      - NF-κB inhibition: Application of specific NF-κB inhibitors, such as the peptide SN50 or the small molecule BAY 11-7082, to reduce pro-inflammatory gene expression and microglial activation.
      - Nrf2 activation: Use of Nrf2 activators, like sulforaphane, dimethyl fumarate, or bardoxolone methyl, to enhance the expression of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes, thereby protecting against fructose-induced oxidative stress and inflammation.
   c. Inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation:
      - Small molecule inhibitors: Application of specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, such as MCC950 or the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate, to block the assembly and activation of the inflammasome complex and reduce IL-1β and IL-18 production.
      - Naturally derived compounds: Use of plant-derived compounds, like curcumin, resveratrol, or epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation through various mechanisms.

5. Gut microbiota modulation:
   a. Probiotics and prebiotics to promote beneficial gut bacteria and SCFA production:
      - Probiotics: Supplementation with specific probiotic strains, such as Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, or Akkermansia muciniphila, which have been shown to reduce inflammation, improve gut barrier function, and modulate microglial activation.
      - Prebiotics: Consumption of prebiotic fibers, like inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), or galactooligosaccharides (GOS), to selectively stimulate the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria, leading to increased production of SCFAs (butyrate, propionate, and acetate) that exert anti-inflammatory effects on microglia.
      - Synbiotics: Combination of probiotics and prebiotics to synergistically promote a healthy gut microbiome and enhance the production of anti-inflammatory metabolites.
   b. Fecal microbiota transplantation to restore a healthy gut microbiome

6. Combination therapies:
   a. Combining dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacological interventions for synergistic effects
   b. Personalized approaches based on individual metabolic and inflammatory profiles

By investigating these potential interventions and their underlying mechanisms, researchers can develop targeted strategies to counteract the detrimental effects of high fructose consumption on microglial function and brain health. A comprehensive approach that addresses the multifaceted nature of fructose-induced neuroinflammation will be essential for developing effective preventive and therapeutic measures. Targeting specific anti-inflammatory pathways, such as modulating NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as well as modulating the gut microbiota through the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, may provide more focused interventions to counteract the effects of high fructose consumption on microglial inflammation and brain health. Additionally, melatonin supplementation at doses ranging from 5-50 mg per day, with the most commonly studied doses falling within the range of 10-30 mg per day, may be an effective pharmacological intervention for managing fructose-induced neuroinflammation.",gcubed

Cognitive dysfunction is also seen in eating disorders, most notably anorexia. Or even in otherwise quite healthy individuals who over train (causing CNS exhaustion) or are suffering from high and chronic stress levels (again causing exhaustion). We don't know how the person in the case report ate or what happened to her weight, but she was most likely running a calorie deficit for two years consecutively. That is quite a long time and to pull that off with keto (or any other diet for that matter), you really need to take care to get proper amount of macro and micro nutrients. Also there could be several other reasons for cognitive problems, one of them simply being at a big calorie deficit for a long time, which can be reproduced with any diet. The fact that the person in question changed diet to non-keto and then her condition improved, doesn't really prove that keto was causing the problems in the first place.

ketoscience,The Lipid-Heart Hypothesis and the Keys Equation Defined the Dietary Guidelines but Ignored the Impact of Trans-fat and High Linoleic Acid Consumption,https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0788/v1,9,1,"

### Comprehensive Summary and Analysis:

#### **Historical Context and Hypothesis Formation**
- **Origins of the Lipid-Heart Hypothesis**: Ancel Keys formulated the lipid-heart hypothesis in the 1950s, asserting that high dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol leads to increased serum cholesterol levels, which in turn, contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and heart disease.
- **Adoption in Dietary Guidelines**: This hypothesis became a cornerstone of dietary recommendations around the world, shaping public health policies and food guidelines, which emphasized reducing total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intake.

#### **Critical Examination of the Keys Equation**
- **Conflation of Fat Types**: The Keys equation, which attempted to predict changes in serum cholesterol based on fat intake, did not distinguish between naturally occurring saturated fats and industrially produced trans fats. This oversight led to guidelines that inaccurately lumped these fats together, failing to address the unique risks posed by trans fats.
- **Impact on Public Health**: By promoting a high intake of polyunsaturated fats (specifically linoleic acid) and ignoring the diverse roles and sources of saturated fats, dietary guidelines may have inadvertently contributed to other health issues, such as inflammatory diseases and imbalances in omega fatty acid ratios.

#### **Reevaluation of Dietary Cholesterol**
- **Weak Correlation with Serum Cholesterol**: Emerging evidence, discussed in the paper, shows that dietary cholesterol has a less significant effect on blood cholesterol levels than previously thought, leading to changes in guidelines that no longer set strict limits on cholesterol intake.
- **Individual Differences**: The paper emphasizes that the impact of dietary cholesterol varies widely among individuals, challenging the one-size-fits-all approach to dietary recommendations.

#### **Contemporary Understanding and Recommendations**
- **Need for Differentiation**: The paper calls for a reevaluation of the health impacts of different types of fats, advocating for a distinction between harmful trans fats and potentially less harmful saturated fats.
- **Importance of Balance**: It highlights the need for dietary guidelines to emphasize a balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids to prevent inflammation and other metabolic issues.
- **Holistic Dietary Patterns**: Rather than isolating single nutrients (like fats or cholesterol), the paper supports guidelines that consider overall dietary patterns and their broader health impacts, encouraging diverse and balanced food intake.

#### **Implications for Future Research and Policy**
- **Research Directions**: The paper suggests that future research should continue to explore the nuanced effects of various fats on health, including long-term studies that differentiate between fat types and their sources.
- **Policy Adjustments**: There is a call for policy makers to update and adjust dietary guidelines based on current scientific evidence, moving away from outdated assumptions about dietary fats and heart disease.

### Conclusion
The paper provides a thorough critique of historical and current dietary guidelines influenced by the lipid-heart hypothesis. It advocates for a shift towards more evidence-based, nuanced, and individualized dietary recommendations that recognize the complex roles of different fats in health and disease.

This expanded analysis reflects the depth of the paper's arguments and the significant implications for dietary research and public health policy.",gcubed

### Objectives

To present an application of specification curve analysis—a novel analytic method that involves defining and implementing all plausible and valid analytic approaches for addressing a research question—to nutritional epidemiology.

### Study Design and Setting

We reviewed all observational studies addressing the effect of red meat on all-cause mortality, sourced from a published systematic review, and documented variations in analytic methods (eg, choice of model, covariates, etc.). We enumerated all defensible combinations of analytic choices to produce a comprehensive list of all the ways in which the data may reasonably be analyzed. We applied specification curve analysis to data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 to 2014 to investigate the effect of unprocessed red meat on all-cause mortality. The specification curve analysis used a random sample of all reasonable analytic specifications we sourced from primary studies.

### Results

Among 15 publications reporting on 24 cohorts included in the systematic review on red meat and all-cause mortality, we identified 70 unique analytic methods, each including different analytic models, covariates, and operationalizations of red meat (eg, continuous vs quantiles). We applied specification curve analysis to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, including 10,661 participants. Our specification curve analysis included 1208 unique analytic specifications, of which 435 (36.0%) yielded a hazard ratio equal to or more than 1 for the effect of red meat on all-cause mortality and 773 (64.0%) less than 1. The specification curve analysis yielded a median hazard ratio of 0.94 (interquartile range: 0.83–1.05). Forty-eight specifications (3.97%) were statistically significant, 40 of which indicated unprocessed red meat to reduce all-cause mortality and eight of which indicated red meat to increase mortality.

### Conclusion

We show that the application of specification curve analysis to nutritional epidemiology is feasible and presents an innovative solution to analytic flexibility.",Triabolical_

The idea is that when you analyze data, you are building a statistical model that you then (typically) perform a hypothesis test on. One assumption of hypothesis tests (i.e. the things that generate a p value that we use to make a decision) is that your model is an accurate-enough representation of the process that generated your data (i.e. how things work in real life), and if it's not then your model is mis-specified or in other words you don't have the right combination of predictor variables to appropriately predict what you want and all your results are wrong.

Ok, enough about the mechanics of specification analysis, back up a level - why? There's a tongue-in-cheek term called researcher degrees of freedom to explain part of the 'reproducibility crisis' in science. Essentially, if you give 100 scientists the exact same data set, they'll come 200 different results and interpretations. This doesn't mean anyone's doing anything wrong or bad, just that there's a lot of options. An important concept in stats is not just what you think the summary statistic is, but how sure you are of that result. For simple truly random data, we know how to estimate that false positive rate just with some math. But with something as complex as human free will we need to do simulations to understand what the true distribution of that curve looks like so that we can estimate the false positive rate, which is essentially what specification analysis is doing. The core question is 'given the entire distribution of options and results, how likely is it that you would get your result just by dumb luck?' 

Bringing it back to this paper, it answers nothing about whether meat is healthy or not. You explicitly cannot draw a conclusion either way from this analysis because it just doesn't ask that question. Instead it says, ""look at all these results - if researchers were making truly unbiased, random choices in their analysis then we would expect to see this distribution of results reported"". If the results reported do not match that distribution, it does not mean anyone is guilty of misconduct, or being bought off, or having an agenda, because there's perfectly logical reasons for those results to be reported. It simply means that maybe someone should take a closer look at what's going on to understand why those choices are being made because right now there's experts who don't understand why some choices are less common even though they're just as reasonable.",Immaculate_Erection

I believe she already had issues with elevated triglyceride levels.  In that case going keto and getting trigs towards 1000 mg/dL severely increases the risk of pancreatitis.

I'm sure there are people who have opinions and can point out some parts.

But as far as I'm concerned, it is about a shift in balance of mainly enzymes to handle/process the difference in volume of fuel.  Everything is already there, it's not like there are new molecules brought into life as far as I know.  Some of the adaptations are fast, others take more time and I'm guessing all together needs to achieve a new balance from where it can slowly get to optimal levels.

Since we don't even really know how to define and measure that adaptation, it is of course hard to tell how long a reversal would take.

People may point out increase in mitochondria but that doesn't necessarily happen.  If you're active instead of metabolically ill then you likely have enough mitochondria.  Mitochondria can decrease but only if you don't use them.

If you take producing ketones as a measure, you can switch that off in no time.

So first we need to have a definition of what adaptation means and how to measure it.  And even if that is in place, there would indeed be a lot of individual variance.",Ricosss

HDL is there in support of fat storage flux.  Not fat flux although that is closely related. I don't think lipidologists have that viewpoint.  Triglycerides, LDL and HDL combined tell you how much you use fat for energy which is the combination of storing it and releasing it for usage.  This is what LMHR is about.  Their lipid profile simply indicates the highest utilization of **dietary** fat for energy.  Dietary specifically because that is what requires a high level of storing and high level of release after storage.

People on high carb can also have low trig low LDL and medium HDL, still OK.  But on high carb if your trigs go up, it means you have too much insulin resistance as it signals insulin is unable to prevent the release of fats from the liver.  You're essentially leaking triglycerides.  That goes along with increased LDL and then you can start worrying about MI.

For CVD risk doctors should take into account diet and trig/HDL to be more precise in their diagnosis but I also understand that the population on keto is minimal versus standard diet so that knowledge simply isn't there and and before a whole medical field accepts such an adjustment, there's a lot more proof needed and a lot more resistance to overcome.",Ricosss

If you're like me and prefer red meat and high cholesterol foods, it has been shown in the data that if you eat low carb (ketogenic) then a diet high in red meat and higher cholesterol foods has the reverse effect and actually improves your lipid numbers.

Lmfao this guy is right. I’d say the same thing to ignore medication. Statins pretty much lowers your cholesterol because it shuts down your liver from producing its own cholesterol. Wtf right? What you need to do is stay hydrated 24/7. Exercise as much as you can, doesn’t matter what type of exercise it is. Eat a clean Whole Foods plant based diet.

Statins don’t actually prevent plaque build up, they stabilize existing plaque by calcifying it. If you don’t have plaque you don’t want to calcify and harden your arteries, as that is actually a form of heart disease.

Length of time for elevated cholesterol is what determines whether or not she has plaque build up. I understand the mechanism of plaque prevention, I didn't feel it was necessary to get into the minutiae of how ststins work. My explanation certainly was factual. It does prevent a further buildup as new plaque cannot form.

>To date, none of the large trials of secondary prevention with statins has shown a reduction in overall mortality in women. ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9416884))

That is not at all what that study says. The conclusion:

>Cholesterol lowering with simvastatin produced similar reductions in relative risk for major coronary events in women compared with men and in elderly (> or = 65 years of age) compared with younger patients. There were too few female deaths to assess the effects on mortality in women. Because mortality rates increased substantially with age, the absolute risk reduction for both all-cause and CHD mortality in simvastatin-treated subjects was approximately twice as great in the older patients.

It states that the risk factors *did* lower for women the same as they did for men. It also says there weren't enough deaths to evaluate the effect on mortality rates in women. That is not the same as not showing a reduction as you falsely imply.

>Perhaps more critically, the primary prevention trials have shown neither an overall mortality benefit, nor even a reduction in cardiovascular end points in women. ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15138247))

That's also not what that study is saying. Why are you attempting to sway people to do things that are bad for them by misrepresenting data? You are either a terrible human or terrible at interpreting results. Either way, you should stop giving advice based on your erroneous interpretations. The conclusion:

>For women without cardiovascular disease, lipid lowering does not affect total or CHD mortality. Lipid lowering may reduce CHD events, but current evidence is insufficient to determine this conclusively. For women with known cardiovascular disease, treatment of hyperlipidemia is effective in reducing CHD events, CHD mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization, but it does not affect total mortality.

The actual interpretation is far more nuanced than you imply. One, this study is looking at people with coronary heart disease. Not the general population or even a population with just elevated lipids, so taking this study and attempting to apply it to the broad swath of the population is intellectually dishonest.

Then, those *without* CVD and with CHD don't appear to achieve any reduction in *CHD* mortality to lowering their lipid levels, with CVD, they do, though total mortality is not lowered in the population *with CHD* and CVD.

Your application of this study to a person who is part of the general population is flawed at best and intentionally destructive at worst.",Ok_Area4853

Those phospholipids are made up of the fatty acyls and are either straight (saturated) or twisted (polyunsaturated).  Being saturated they stack nicely against each other while twisted makes them move a lot and causes an unstable layer.  The more unstable, the more cholesterol is attracted into it to create that needed stability.

A theory as far as I know.  Someone else may have more knowledge and/or can confirm the above.  I still have doubts on it as I read papers that showed the distribution of saturated/mono-unsaturated/poly-unsaturated is fixed.  But that was for the cell layer.

There's a lean hyper-responder trial going on right now - search for Dave Feldman to find out more - that may give answers for a subset. One problem we have is that keto is a relatively new diet and there's not enough of us to show up in the large data sets. 

Much of the belief that LDL is bad comes from the statin trials, but the problem is that statins have other effects than lowering LDL. 

Two thoughts:

If you want a good exploration of the alternate hypothesis, read Malcolm Kendrick's ""the clot thickens"". My personal opinion is that his theory is likely right, but you should make your own decision.

The focus on LDL is, at best, short-sighted. The statin trials have shown some modest reductions in heart disease among some populations, but they have been modest - perhaps a 30% reduction. 

The effect of type II diabetes on heart disease risk is well studied, and it's somewhere in the range of 2x-4x. So focusing on LDL makes little sense when half the adult US population is either prediabetic or has type II - if you can fix the insulin resistance behind type II you will have more impact than reducing LDL. Not to mention statins increase the risk of type II. 

But statins are hugely popular drugs that make ridiculous amounts of money for pharma, so we're stuck with fixating on LDL.",Triabolical_

Serum levels are regulated by your liver, not how much of it you eat.

The pathological case is where your circulating LDL is damaged by oxidation (think the smoking connection to heart disease) and glycation (think the diabetes connection to heart disease).

Such damage results in the remnants of LDL being unable to be recycled in your liver, hence the particle count goes up.

This can be detected directly with LDL fractionation tests that show a spread of the LDL sizes. Lots of little ones (aka , small dense LDL) is bad.  The Trig/HDL ratio is a cheaper test, that correlates with the same answer.

The causal relation appears to be that these particularly small and sticky LDL's get stuck in the tiny capillaries of the arterial walls, where they block oxygen supply, causing sclerosis. It's not from the inside of the arterial wall, and notice that people don't get venous sclerosis, because vein walls aren't thick enough to have the problem.",NerdyWeightLifter

For background, I used to be pretty heavily keto, but going to medical school helped me learn not just how to read evidence based medicine, but how to find good quality trials, data, and papers to help come to a medical judgement.

For those claiming that normal levels of cholesterol are associated with a higher risk of heart attacks / heart disease / death / whatever, I’d highly recommend checking out [this](https://youtu.be/a3lHHnOHyr8?si=7w-d4_D-p3kE-WXj) video that busts this myth. The U curve association is commonly seen in epidemiological studies and tends to confound real patterns. This allows people to incorrectly view LDL and disease association, making it seem like a “gotcha,” or a win for keto.

The hard truth is that high LDL has consistently been associated with poorer outcomes in relation to cardiovascular disease and mortality. There have been no long term data studying the vascular safety of ketogenic diets. Until real data emerges with proper clinical trials in reputed journals, we need to dispel the myth of keto being the solution to all of humanities ailments, as many here and on r/keto regularly do. We simply don’t know enough to make such a claim. To suggest otherwise is absurd.

Current data from the strongest trials conducted over several decades with peer review suggest a lower LDL improves CV morbidity / mortality, and that a mediterranean diet is most healthful.

What really saddens me is that people have been studying nutrition science and metabolism their whole lives, have multiple degrees in this, have been awarded several grants and done the highest levels of research work on this stuff in humanity’s history, and their work gets overshadowed by armchair experts or tik tok influencers who believe the work of every major scientist and health organization is flawed. What makes you think you know better?

If you think some Big Industry paid off Big Science or Big Pharma or Big Whatever, it literally doesn’t matter. I don’t care who’s making money as long as my patients are healthy.

And if you want to prove keto’s efficacy, go run a trial. If new evidence emerges proving keto’s superiority, I’ll happily reconsider my position in light of new evidence.

All this is not to say that keto is 100% bad. Most diets have some helpful qualities. Keto is great for people trying to lose weight quickly over a short term period, for example. And it is great for epileptics. I’m on this subreddit still because I find some of the science and metabolism intriguing, but I would never recommend it to a patient because it doesn’t have enough data to support its safety.

Follow high quality evidence and data in your health decisions. I always recommend reviewing the most up-to-date dietary [guidelines](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf) and speaking to professionals (read: not “experts”, but professionals). It’s always great to have theories and ideas, but we don’t act based on whims and ideas. We act based on data.

My recommendation regarding your health question is to make an appointment with a physician who researches lipid science at a center of excellence, and they can guide you through the most recent data and evidence and help you make a decision as to what is best for your health.",lonesomefish
ketoscience,Is high LDL bad or not?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/1bnubhw/is_high_ldl_bad_or_not/,28,89,"No LDL is not bad.  LDL can contribute to the worsening of the condition but and varying aspects of LDL can contribute more but it doesn't mean that LDL is the sole factor.  There is no such thing evidenced so far that just having high LDL causes atherosclerosis (ASCVD).  Not even in people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).  In those with FH who do die early of ASCVD, they have other factors that worsen their condition faster which is related to clotting.

Clotting is the final plug in the narrowed pipeline that triggers an event.  The narrowing however is the result of damage to the lining of the artery.  That lining gets fixed by a new layer of cells which makes the arterial wall thicker.  That thicker wall however now is at risk of hypoxia.  The cells in that area will produce signaling molecules (cytokines) to resolve this.

I'm speculating but hypoxic areas are ideal for anaerobic bacteria.  Whether this is the cause or purely the cytokines.. macrophages come to the problematic area.  Macrophages will take up lipids (LDL particles).  Primarily oxidized LDLs.  The reason for becoming oxidized is due to diet but also again bacteria so macrophages take them up and strip apart the LDL particles to reuse the lipids for energy.

All these steps would resolve the situation just fine as it is in fact a (high level) description of the healing process but if the environment (high carb high sugar high insulin) is unfavorable then that healing process is not perfect and may just lead to a worsening condition over time.

Either way, if you look into the whole process in more detail then the role of LDL only becomes smaller and eventually minimal at most.  There are sufficient papers to cast doubt on the benefits of cholesterol lowering drugs.  Positive results that are achieved are either achieved through nice tricks or could be explained by additional properties of the drugs which only help in delaying an event.

The increased HDL will naturally lower the LDL by assisting the Liver in metabolizing the LDL more efficiently. LDL means Low density, so it’s typically stored in the arteries, under muscle and around the organs, which makes it dangerous as it’s not readily used as fuel , just as HDL ( high density) is. 
I did my thesis on keto in my food science undergrad, and frankly it’s a hit and miss, simply because most people don’t know what they are doing. They are consuming excess amounts of animal products (dairy and meat) , restricting the other necessary macro and micronutrients and slowly degrading and destroying their organs from the inside out. Not only that but restricting their body of necessary nutrients and disrupting their natural biochemical mechanisms for things to function accordingly. 
I agree keto is beneficial on and off when eating a natural whole food and plant based diet, while still making sure the body is getting its necessary nutrients, removing highly acidic and processed foods. It has  been shown to lower risk of nervous system disorders, because of the removal of excess simple sugars, in which feed candida, increase amyloid production in the brain and that good old bad bacteria in the intestinal tract, causing all sorts of issues. 
Although, if you were to simply remove processed sugars from the body and replace complex and simple sugars with natural sugars such high fibre fruit, the story in how to body detoxifies lipids and toxins through the liver differs and what is a healthy diet shifts and changes, because then you are supporting and helping your organs such as the pancreas, liver , kidneys , and colon out.
However, every persons biochemical makeup differs, lifestyle factors, genetics , blood type, all come in to play . 
Listen to the scientists that have studied nutritional sciences, food science, biochemistry, anatomy, holistic nutrition, food microbiology, food chemistry, and that participate and follow research funded by non profits, and universities and that receive grants. Stay away from research funded by government self focus, food companies, meaning, the outcome of their research bring them more money by proving a food that can be readily sold to the public.

but most doctors, assuming they follow the same standards (since they have to be re-certified every several years), will probably give the same advice, regardless of whether they go to a center of excellence. so you’re right—if the OP can only go to a local clinic, that is fine too. Also it wouldn’t hurt them to get a second opinion locally as well, if they are looking for one.

I’ve actually felt the opposite. It seems clinical guidelines are changing almost daily (for things like infection management and primary prevention strategies for things like cancer), but the training (like the stuff we learn in medical school) feels very static. Exams often test outdated practices, and they update rather slowly over the years. All our attendings tell us to just memorize it the way the boards want us to for now, but to realize that management will change once we enter clerkships.

As far as industry influences go, I’m sure they’re everywhere. Hard to say who is influencing what (and to what extent)—so we try to follow the data as best we can.

I personally have reached the conclusion that LDL is meaningless or nearly so.  As always, the body is so complex, it's hard to rule anything out, but I don't see much evidence that LDL is attacking the arterial wall to get in and cause damage.  (There may be something with oxidized LDL, but even there, I'm not sure there is.) 

And once you start researching LMHRs and why they get ridiculously high LDL, you realize that LDL is part of an energy transport mechanism. Any time you're raising VLDL, you're raising LDL. And you raise VLDL for energy transport.  

And LDL is also part of the immune system, which is probably why older folks with higher LDL tend to live longer.

I’m not sure what a niche situation would be where all resources are exhausted. Patients who inquire about data in regards to their health situation should *always* be referred to a physician. Unless a patient is looking for alternative medicine because they’ve stopped trusting in evidence-based medicine, there is no point where all resources would be exhausted.

If someone comes to this subreddit to learn more about ketogenic diets *in theory*, then that makes sense. If someone is using this data to apply *in practice*, then we have a problem. Because like I said, current data on keto does not have that level of power to inform health decisions.

Had the post simply asked, “What is the consensus on LDL,” then that is sensible to allow. When a patient clearly is using input from here (where many of the commenters have no formal education in this field and have no business giving out health advice), then I don’t see reason to allow it. Again, I think you’ll find very few (if any) niche situations where it wouldn’t be prudent to refer to a physician.

Very few if any RCTs on here that prove *without confounding* that ketogenic diets are superior for metabolic health. *At most*, they have shown noninferiority. And on the several that do show changes, even the authors admit that the changes they see are likely due to overall weight loss.

Because, yes, the metabolic changes in ketosis make it easier to lose weight *quicker*. And weight loss has been consistently shown to be the number one factor to ameliorate metabolic syndrome.

* clusterattacks reduced by more then 2 times. Coming from 14 attacks each month, now only 1 each month on average by also adding magic mushrooms.
* severe nightly leg cramps: gone. First became worse, probably because of oxalate dumping.
* waking up with my heart in my throat: gone
* waking up with acid reflux: gone
* eye sight: improved on both eyes with 1,00

* mental clarity: improved
* insulin resistance: gone

The mediterranean diet does not advocate for a low fat diet. In fact, the evidence is weak that a high fat diet increases the risk of heart disease. What does increase risk of heart disease are saturated fats and trans fats ([source - meta analysis of 60 controlled trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12716665/)). The mediterranean diet recommends high fruit and vegetable consumption, fatty fish and olive oil consumption, and whole grains for fiber intake. You could technically do mediterranean diet in ketosis if you wanted to, just by increasing the amounts of fish and olive oil and reducing the amount of whole grains.

I’m not sure what you mean by “their guidelines force them to.” The guidelines are designed around the research, not the other way around. Claiming otherwise is conspiratorial and requires substantial evidence to support it—not just what your hear on tik tok. If you actually read the guidelines and view all the citations, they link to super high quality published data, from some of the largest trials around the world. And if you’ve actually been involved in research, you’d know that institutions keep databases of trial data that report to societal databases, which publish the guidelines. They’re highly evidence based. And suggesting otherwise invalidates the work of decades of the most prolific researchers who have been pioneers in our understanding of longevity and heart disease.

Look, I have no problems with you or whoever doing keto. But let’s not sit here and promote it to the general public as if we know what we’re talking about, because we both know there isn’t enough data to support that. The simple truth is that keto doesn’t have enough RCTs over many years to prove it. If one day that changes, then fine. But until then, it’s irresponsible to make unsubstantiated claims.

You're right. There should be no promotion of diets to the general public, period, because there is only observational data.

For instance, I observe that the dietary patters pushed over the last 80 years have led to an explosion of auto immune disorders, cancers, heart attack and heart disease, as well as a decline in life expectancy.

ketoscience,Is high LDL bad or not?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/1bnubhw/is_high_ldl_bad_or_not/,28,89,"So unlike you, I actually took the time to go through everything you linked to.

On “clinicaltrials.gov,” if you search for ketogenic diet under interventions, you get 397 results. If you search for mediterranean diet, you get 478 results. You forgot to mention that, didn’t you? Funny how that happens. I will again make the point that regardless of how many trials are ongoing, it doesn’t matter because none of these are published. We make guidelines based on published research, not preliminary data.

Just by pure numbers alone, you linked to roughly 30 clinical trials claiming keto superiority. Even if they were not cherry picked, ~30 is nowhere near close to the hundreds of trials done on mediterranean.

Most of your linked trials are low carb, not ketogenic. And I personally have no problem with low carb. Additionally, certain studies like the one published in Atherosclerosis 2016 were actually done with low saturated fat.

As I’ve pointed out elsewhere on this thread, keto is great for short term weight loss, so it’s not surprising that these RCTs show short term weight loss. Guess what else demonstrably improves every metric of metabolic syndrome? Weight loss. So on paper, ketogenic diet seems great.

And yet, not a single RCT you linked shows long term data (correct me if I’m wrong). Several of your trials quit the RCT approach after 1-2 years and went on to report observational data, finding that even though keto group had better numbers in the short term, they had greater mortality in the long term. I take this with a grain of salt, of course, because it is not controlled, but it is still interesting to see.

[Here](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/38/32/2459/3745109?login=false) is a link to a report that has 20 million person-years of follow up, claiming convincingly that LDL is associated with heart disease. Can you find me anything similar to vouch for keto? Until you can, I will continue to promote mediterranean.

You will perhaps claim that it is impossible to do a trial for that long. Perhaps you’re right. Can you at least find substantial observational data going back several decades that shows less mortality on a high fat diet? I couldn’t find anything.

Just because you can lose weight faster with an intervention does not make it superior for overall health. There is importance to doing things safely. Let me emphasize this: *There is no long-term evidence to support the safety of ketogenic diets.*

I’m not trying to do a “gotcha” or anything. I’m legitimately serious—if you have substantial data supporting long-term safety of keto or high saturated fat diet, then send it my way.

Your observations about exploding obesity and diabetes etc are correct. It may even be plausible that it is a result of a high carb diet. But I’m not sure how you get from there to “best way to prevent metabolic syndrome is to have sky high LDL.” Is clean eating, sleep, and exercise not enough?

There are so many things that can cause the obesity pandemic, and y’all chose to focus on carbs. I get it—sugar is awful. But that doesn’t mean that the answer is to consume copious amounts of saturated fat to meet your daily caloric needs. Like there has to be a balance somewhere. You can cut out the sugar and eat clean and still reap the long term benefits.

My final point is that I’m happy to debate the science. But at the end of the day, you should not be promoting health advice to patients that isn’t based on the strongest data for health. I don’t normally comment on this sub (I’m just here to read papers), but I’m taking the time to do so right now because y’all are choosing to misguide a patient. It’s irresponsible.

>For the 2020 guidelines, the DGAC also conducted a review of saturated fats \[48\]. A recent analysis of the studies included in this review found that 88% did not support a link between these fats and heart disease \[33▪▪\]. Due to a new rule introduced by the USDA for this guidelines process, the 2020 DGAC was not allowed to examine external review papers and was therefore unable to consider any of the approximately 20 review papers described above. Top experts in the field attempted to introduce this evidence via written comments submitted formally to the USDA \[33▪▪\], in addition to meeting with the relevant senior staff members at both HHS and USDA, and submitting a letter to members of Congress \[49\]. Among the external review papers was now a 2021 ‘State of the Art Review,’ in the highly regarded Journal of the American College of Cardiology\[15\], whose authors included 4 members of previous DGACs and which found that there is ‘no robust evidence that current population-wide arbitrary upper limits on saturated fat consumption in the United States will prevent cardiovascular disease or reduce mortality.’ The paper was named one of the top 100 articles of 2021 by the journal's editor in chief \[50\], yet this and other reviews were ultimately not considered in the 2020 DGAC review on saturated fats. The DGAC final report makes no mention of any shift in scientific thinking on these fats and concludes that the evidence linking them to heart disease is ‘strong.’

>An analysis of the 2020 DGAC subcommittee in charge of the saturated fat review found numerous intellectual, financial, and even religious conflicts of interest that may have contributed to a bias against saturated fats \[51,52▪▪\]. For instance, one member was found to have chaired five vegetarian conferences from 1997 to 2018, which might reflect a bias against saturated fats, since a more liberal policy towards these fats would inevitably allow for greater consumption of animal foods.

it’s impossible to have a discussion with you when you aren’t even reading my data. im taking time to read what you’re sending, and you won’t even read what im suggesting.

The purpose of the PNAS article you sent was to confirm that neanderthals were carnivore—it provides zero epidemiological data. by citing the PNAS article, you’re making a common logical fallacy in suggesting that our historic diet means that this is exactly what we should be eating. This actually doesn’t make much sense—we’ve also evolved to store fat in our abdomens; does that mean we should keep storing fat there? Of course not—fat accumulates around the pancreas and causes pancreatic dysfunction, contributing to DMII, among other things.

We have evolved imperfectly—we’re not as well-oiled as you think we are (but you would need to go to medical school to understand this). Our diets at the time were based on what we could hunt and scavenge. That doesn’t mean they were perfect for us. No single species is perfectly adapted to its environment. Humans, as advanced as we are, are still trying to adapt to our environment (antibiotic resistance, for example).

And to whichever article you’re citing about industry involvement—people are going to try to find ways to take monetary advantage of every situation that arises. If the world were to suddenly shift keto, do you not think people would milk that? Hell, we’ve already got carnivore influencers selling their own supplements — there is no freedom from industry influence. 

In any case, *I’m still waiting for an article from you showing reduced morbidity / mortality on a long-term ketogenic / high saturated fat diet.* Keep it coming, buddy—you’re getting nowhere with this. You’re dancing around the absence of the real data, instead citing evolutionary diets and industry influence. I agree that we evolved as heavy meat eaters. I agree that there is heavy industry influence. I agree that keto has a lot of short term benefits. But before I recommend to patients, I need data ensuring long term safety.

Edit: didn’t see the last article you sent until after my comment. but that also doesnt help your argument. so what if no cap was established? the point is to limit saturated fat intake. we might not have the data to know where to set a hard limit, but what we do know is that higher saturated fat intake is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Some people get lung cancer after smoking for only 10 years. Others smoke their whole life and don’t get lung cancer. Does that mean, since we don’t know where the hard cutoff is for smoking, that we shouldn’t tell people to limit cigarettes? That’s the kind of logic you’re bringing into this",lonesomefish

There are 0 RCTs showing causation that LDL *causes ASCVD.* It is *their opinion* that it causes ASCVD base on EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES. The RCTs on LDL only show that it is possible to lower LDL on specific drugs when compared with placebo, and it is working from a basic assumption that more LDL means more plaques and therefore more death. When in fact, the LMHR study proves that this is not the case.

Ergo, *bullshit FFQ studies.*

>it’s impossible to have a discussion with you when you aren’t even reading my data

>it provides zero epidemiological data

Thank God. It actually has hard data.

>does that mean we should keep storing fat there?

Yes it does. We should store fat there for use in famine. What we should not do is store fat there in the absence of famine. Don't be obtuse. Where else would you store fat, in your feet?

>fat accumulates around the pancreas and causes pancreatic dysfunction, contributing to DMII, among other things.

Only if chronic, not in the short term, as these are reverseable, as are most symptoms if avoided long term.

>*I’m still waiting for an article from you showing reduced morbidity / mortality on a long-term ketogenic / high saturated fat diet.*

I'm not sure why you're waiting for this. I've told you this study does not and will not exist. It is unethical to do so. You cannot take babies from birth and lock them in a room and force feed them a diet for their whole life and study the out comes. One - you would die before results were available. 2 - it is cost prohibitive. And most importantly, 3 - it is unethical as fuck.

What we do have is evidence that the Mediterranean diet as a concept was not made up from legit observation. It was invented, whole cloth, as a result of Ancel Keys 22 country study, wherein he observed Post-world war 2 countries who were experiencing famine DURING LENT.

Your health guidance is bullshit stacked on top of bullshit supported by moneyed interests who have no incentive to take a critical eye to their own data sets.

No. This is incorrect. Only long term does it cause disease. Babies store fat in these areas predominantly as well. It is best retrieved here for easy liponeogenesis for emergency use.

If you are starving, you want quick, easy access energy. It makes no sense to store it far away from vital organs.

But again, you’d need to go to medical school to learn about how hormones affect the location of fat storage, and how location has little to no impact on overall lipid circulation. If you’ve looked inside a cadaver, you’d understand how fat storage works. And if you understood metabolism and biochemistry, you’d understand that lipids are not used for fast energy—therefore, they don’t *necessarily* need to be stored nearby. (I’m curious now—Is this how you talk out of your ass when you’re trying to convince someone about your diet? Wow, you are dangerous! like a walking r/confidentlyincorrect)

But since you continue to claim that humans evolved perfectly, I’ll provide another example for you and any other future readers: sleep position. If you run a google image search on mammals sleeping (try it), you will notice nearly every image shows mammals sleeping on their stomach. Contrary to what most people believe, humans would actually benefit greatly if we could sleep on our stomachs. The pericardial sac presses against the pleura, preventing the full extent of lung expansion. Flipping around would allow the lungs to expand without resistance. Unfortunately, our head and neck anatomy developed in such a way after we became bipedal such that we lost the ability to sleep prone comfortably (most humans will now sleep on their side—going against our evolutionary anatomy). Still, lying prone is recommended during respiratory infection to allow for maximal aeration. So I will again repeat: we are evolutionarily imperfect. I can give dozens of more examples of this—we see a lot of it in medicine.

This is all besides the point. The rapidity of your responses to my comments with linked material (as well as your inaccurate summaries of them, and your immediate dismissal of them) indicates to me that not only are you not reading anything I am sending, but that you simply don’t value a discussion where you can hear opposing views and engage in critical thinking. That is not how science works.

At this point, you’re arguing for the sake of argument. It’s almost as if you’ve attached your whole identity to this diet, and anyone who goes against it is attacking your identity (that actually seems to happen a lot on this sub). There is no ownership or identity required in scientific thought. All science requires is an open mind. Like I said, I’ve tried keto—I’ve read all the same papers as you have. I’ve kept an open mind. Even in this discussion, I’ve read everything you linked (sometimes more carefully than even you have!). And after examining the totality of the evidence, I’ve chosen a side. And I’m willing to change sides again if the data supports it in the future.

Thankfully, my point here was made a couple comments back **when you admitted that there is no data on the long term safety of ketogenic / carnivore / high-fat diets, as you write “this study does not and will not exist.”** I doubt it will not exist, but right now, it certainly does not exist, as you correctly pointed out!

**Thus, since we have no long term data on it, we do not recommend it to patients. Case closed.**

But if you send me a dismissive reply with no factual basis (as I expect you will, but I’d be happy to be proven wrong), I won’t respond from here on out. Good talk.

That all said, this sub really shouldn’t influence your health decisions, and I would urge you to visit a physician—your health is too important to be swayed by potentially misinformed voices on the internet (including my own).

You're right. And the most mobile of the fats, the brown visceral fat, liberates first in an emergency. And hormones dictate all of this. But apparently you've never had children otherwise your pediatrician would have taught you better.

Lipids *are* used for fast energy in a state of famine. I understand reading is hard, but try to keep up. This is why we have visceral fat. But you just keep on believing the human body is stupid.

>Oxidative stress can affect the protein, lipids, and DNA of the cells and thus, play a crucial role in several pathophysiological conditions. It has already been established that oxidative stress has a close association with inflammation via nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway. Amino acids are notably the building block of proteins and constitute the major class of nitrogen-containing natural products of medicinal importance. They exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, including the ability to activate NRF2, a transcription factor that regulates endogenous antioxidant responses. Moreover, amino acids may act as synergistic antioxidants as part of our dietary supplementations. This has aroused research interest in the NRF2-inducing activity of amino acids. Interestingly, amino acids' activation of NRF2-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) signaling pathway exerts therapeutic effects in several diseases. Therefore, the present review will discuss the relationship between different amino acids and activation of NRF2–KEAP1 signaling pathway pinning their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. We also discussed amino acids formulations and their applications as therapeutics. This will broaden the prospect of the therapeutic applications of amino acids in a myriad of inflammation and oxidative stress-related diseases. This will provide an insight for designing and developing new chemical entities as NRF2 activators.",basmwklz

>Glucose has long been considered the primary fuel source for the brain. However, glucose levels fluctuate in the brain during sleep, intense circuit activity, or dietary restrictions, posing significant metabolic stress. Here, we demonstrate that the mammalian brain utilizes pyruvate as a fuel source, and pyruvate can support neuronal viability in the absence of glucose. Nerve terminals are sites of metabolic vulnerability within a neuron and we show that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is a critical step in oxidative ATP production in hippocampal terminals. We find that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is post-translationally modified by lysine acetylation which in turn modulates mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. Importantly, our data reveal that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier regulates distinct steps in synaptic transmission, namely, the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic vesicle release and the efficiency of vesicle retrieval, functions that have profound implications for synaptic plasticity. In summary, we identify pyruvate as a potent neuronal fuel and mitochondrial pyruvate uptake as a critical node for the metabolic control of synaptic transmission in hippocampal terminals.

**Highlights**

Serum pyruvate is taken up by the brain and efficiently oxidized in the TCA cycle.

The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is essential for presynaptic energy metabolism.

Acetylation of the MPC complex modulates mitochondrial pyruvate uptake.

MPC activity regulates the release and retrieval of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals.",basmwklz

Abstract:
>In the present study, we examined the mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (mH2O2) generating capacity of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) and compared it to components of the electron transport chain (ETC) using liver mitochondria isolated from male and female C57BL6N mice. We show for the first time there are some sex dimorphisms in the production of mH2O2 by ETC complexes I and III when mitochondria are fueled with different substrates. However, in our investigations into these sex effects, we made the unexpected discovery that: 1. KGDH serves as a major mH2O2 supplier in male and female liver mitochondria and 2. KGDH can form mH2O2 when mitochondria are energized with fatty acids, but only when malate is used to prime the Krebs cycle. Surprisingly, 2-keto-3-methylvaleric acid (KMV), a site-specific inhibitor for KGDH, nearly abolished mH2O2 generation in both male and female liver mitochondria oxidizing palmitoyl-carnitine. KMV inhibited mH2O2 production in liver mitochondria from male and female mice oxidizing myristoyl-, octanoyl-, or butyryl-carnitine. S1QEL 1.1 (S1) and S3QEL 2 (S3), compounds that inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by complexes I and III, respectively, without interfering with OxPhos, had a negligible effect on the rate of mH2O2 production when pyruvate or acyl-carnitines were used as fuels. However, inclusion of KMV in reaction mixtures containing S1 and/or S3 almost abolished mH2O2 generation. Together, our findings suggest KGDH is the main mH2O2 generator in liver mitochondria, even when fatty acids are used as fuel.",basmwklz

ketoscience,Thermodynamic Analysis to Evaluate the Effect of Diet on Brain Glucose Metabolism: The Case of Fish Oil (2024),https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/5/631,9,2,"
Abstract:
>Inefficient glucose metabolism and decreased ATP production in the brain are linked to ageing, cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). This study employed thermodynamic analysis to assess the effect of fish oil supplementation on glucose metabolism in ageing brains. Data from previous studies on glucose metabolism in the aged human brain and grey mouse lemur brains were examined. The results demonstrated that Omega-3 fish oil supplementation in grey mouse lemurs increased entropy generation and decreased Gibbs free energy across all brain regions. Specifically, there was a 47.4% increase in entropy generation and a 47.4 decrease in Gibbs free energy in the whole brain, indicating improved metabolic efficiency. In the human model, looking at the specific brain regions, supplementation with Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) reduced the entropy generation difference between elderly and young individuals in the cerebellum and particular parts of the brain cortex, namely the anterior cingulate and occipital lobe, with 100%, 14.29%, and 20% reductions, respectively. The Gibbs free energy difference was reduced only in the anterior cingulate by 60.64%. This research underscores that the application of thermodynamics is a comparable and powerful tool in comprehending the dynamics and metabolic intricacies within the brain.",basmwklz

Reading the article a bit, they claim positive results because of the result of entropy increase but on the other hand the ageing brain is marked by increased entropy.

What I can spot as difference is that generating more entropy is good but accumulating entropy is bad.  Trying to scan through the paper it seems that they measure entropy by heat escaping.  Hence thermodynamics measurement.

Trying to translate it: more heat production from the brain means higher metabolism.  This means that the brain is able to access more energy and utilize more energy.

If I'm correct with the above, the question becomes: 

* did the mice have a non-optimal access to energy and therefor were restricted but omega-3 reduced that restriction?  
* Or did their brain already have optimal access but omega-3 increased access even further AND stimulated higher usage?
* Or does the omega-3 cause more damage (ROS) so that more repair is required and this repair is what increases metabolism?",Ricosss
ketoscience,Dietary lipid is largely deposited in skin and rapidly affects insulating properties (2024 - Preprint),https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3957002/v1,15,1,"Abstract:
>Skin has been shown to be a regulatory hub for energy expenditure and metabolism: mutations of skin lipid metabolism enzymes can change the rate of thermogenesis and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. However, little is known about the physiological basis for this function. Here we show that the thermal properties of skin are highly reactive to diet: within three days, a high fat diet reduces heat transfer through skin. In contrast, a dietary manipulation that prevents obesity accelerates energy loss through skins. We found that skin was the largest target in a mouse body for dietary fat delivery, and that fat was assimilated both by epidermis and by dermal white adipose tissue. Dietary triglyceride acyl groups persist in skin for weeks after feeding. Using multi-modal lipid profiling, we have implicated both keratinocytes and sebocytes in the altered lipids which correlate with thermal function. In response to high fat feeding, wax diesters and ceramides accumulate, and triglycerides become more saturated. In contrast, in response to the dramatic loss of adipose tissue that accompanies restriction of the branched chain amino acid isoleucine, skin becomes highly heat-permeable: skins shows limited uptake of dietary lipids and editing of wax esters, and acquires a signature of depleted signaling lipids, which include the acyl carnitines and lipid ethers. We propose that skin should be routinely included in physiological studies of lipid metabolism, given the size of the skin lipid reservoir and its adaptable functionality.",basmwklz

The discussion postulates increased GABA  as a primary mechanism underlying the observed effects but also noted conflicting literature related to increased GABA in ketogenic nutrition.

The authors also mention the role of cortisol regulation in the observed effect. Yes, we know initially cortisol tends to spike, but with continued time in ketosis and fat adaptation, cortisol tends to decrease - I believe HPA axis regulation is probably a key mechanism for the effects of ketogenic nutrition. Since salivary and serum cortisol rise acutely in response to stress, it might be interesting to look at other inflammatory cytokines and/or c-reactive protein in individuals on ketogenic plans vs standard American diets.

Anecdotally, I have found similar positive alterations in mood, perceived psychological well-being, and perceived stress for the last 5 years eating strict keto with occasional 72-96 hour fasts.

The problem for the perception however is that the authors would expect a drop in glucose levels during this time frame.  Glucose did not drop but circulating NEFA did drop.  So one has to assume here that insulin was effective on NEFA suppression but not on glucose suppression.

If we consider the population, T2D, then we can assume there was a degree of fatty liver present which means an insulin resistant liver.  This is also clear from their baseline blood glucose and baseline insulin.

So what likely happened is that the rise in insulin before the glucose was ingested, primed the uptake of glucose into various cells (probably mostly adipose and muscle).  Keep in mind that for muscle cells insulin stimulates GLUT4 expression which increases glucose uptake.  It may not have been statistically significant but you can spot already a slight decline of glucose in the 30 minutes for the KME group.

I do not see any support for the conclusion of the authors.  I have written a comment about this via pubpeer. Waiting for approval.

But the data against it is painfully poor. The biggest problem is that you are taking athletes who are nearly all used to a high carb diet and putting them on a keto diet for a short period of time. It should surprise nobody with even a basic understanding of exercise physiology that this will reduce in reduced performance. Aerobic adaptations are well-established to be long-term adaptations - it's not uncommon for base training periods to be months in length. 

The other problems I have is they have a small perspective on what drives sport performance. 

In cycling - and some other sports - body weight is very important. Most teams use some sort of glucose-depleted training to help with that, which is the same sort of adaptation you get on a low carb diet. It's not a power adaptation, it's a weight adaptation. I don't know if I'm more or less powerful on a low carb diet, but it's really obvious that I climb better at 160 lbs than I do at 180 lbs. 

The other issue is fueling. Many endurance athletes who do longer events have significant fueling issues because they are trying to process huge amounts of glucose into their systems to keep their performance up. They bonk, they have the dreaded ""GI issues"", they aren't confident in their approach. Driving more energy from fat helps a lot.

The final issue is pure health. Lots of us older athletes - like Noakes himself - have ended up pretty insulin resistant following the recommended ""healthy athlete"" diet.",Triabolical_

1) The vast majority of exercise science has looked at athletes who were born and raised on a high carb diet.  Could we not expect that growing up on such a diet, the body is optimized to get the best out of such a diet?  Although we can fairly easy switch to other diets and survive, can we equally thrive on them?  Are there subtle nuances embedded in our body that do not change easily anymore which would favor the diet we grew up with?  Maternal famine affects the offspring for life, why would it not be the case for diet composition?

2) The last roughly 60\~70 years of research has looked into how to optimize performance on a high carb diet.  We are just starting to experiment with high fat very low carb.  Give it 60\~70 years and then we'll have done enough research to optimize performance on keto and see how far we've been able to stretch it.

The study's design does not allow for causal analysis and lacks a comparison group, so we can only infer associations.

It appears that for some, the metabolic reduction is significant, while for others it's minor, aligning with what I've observed in related studies. Even a 100 kcal/day imbalance can accumulate over time. As in many areas within the nutrition field, these studies reveal extensive individual variability and lack of control over many variables.

I am aware that the study involved an extreme diet and exercise program, and these results may not reflect the outcomes of more moderate lifestyle changes. However, it introduces a note of caution about potential metabolic reductions. I mentioned this study to counter the claims that one doesn't need to worry about a slowing metabolism. The only firm conclusion I can draw is that some people may indeed be affected.

From my perspective, a reduced metabolism isn't inherently problematic. An efficient metabolism could even be beneficial, although this particular benefit is not derived from the study but from other literature.

I first started in that sub in 2010, and everyone was so great.  The idea back then was that most people actually consumed a bit more calories than the regular BMR calculators would suggest.  No one was rabidly chanting CICO, there was healthy discussion and debate, or at least as healthy as it ever is on Reddit.

For myself, I failed dozens of times, throughout my 20s to lose weight and keep it off via calorie reduction.  My body seems to be happy at 360lbs.  Regular dieting got me down to 320 then I'd stall every time.

My BMR was around 2500 kcal IIRC.  When I started keto, aiming for 20g carbs, my daily calorie goal went up to 2850 kcal.  Using those numbers, over the next year, I lost 100lbs.

Unfortunately, even though I increased my exercise, even doing CrossFit, and kept to my macros; the weight came back after about five years.

All that is to say that:

A) If CICO was so easy, and something something law of thermodynamics, then why would I die if I drank motor oil for my calories?  Or ate wood chips?  If you put motor oil and or wood chips into a bomb calorimeter, they burn and release energy.  So, obviously there are more factors then calories, and also talking about laws of thermodynamics in relation to weight loss is just stupid.

B) That WP article was just an opinion piece.  The author has all kinds of them, one was titled something like Calories In Calories Out is the only thing that matters in weight loss, so I guess they're an r/keto mod.  Maybe that mod literally linked their own opinion article as proof.

The article is suspect.  The first study they link to disprove the Metabolic downturn from weight loss was a study of a handful of women that lost something like 6lbs on average.  Since that weight loss didn't cause big metabolic changes, then obviously losing 50x more weight must be exactly the same.

C) Between the various weight loss databases and the biggest loser study, I'm not sure why it's so hard to accept that for some people, long term weight loss might not be in the cards, save for using surgical interventions I suppose.  

Surgical interventions and even just being constantly stressed about being overweight have their own health impacts.  So maybe there's a dividing line somewhere where is actually better to just be happy and fat.  Personally my blood pressure, cholesterol, AC1/blood sugar, etc are perfectly fine for a 40 year old man.  My arteries are free of plaque, and my weight doesn't stop me from doing anything I want to do.  So if no reasonable weight loss strategy works, I'm left to wonder if I shouldn't just keep active, and not pay attention to my weight.

There are two big problems with studies like these.

A couple of remarks here.  

First of all the baseline is below 10 mU/L.  A doubling to 20 mU/L is not to be neglected.  Insulin has a logarithmic effect. And we see here for the lean meat that insulin stays elevated for at least 3 hours while for fat it already starts to subside as of around 45 minutes.

Secondly, the test meals were liquid for carbs and fat while it was a real piece of meat for the protein.  This resulted in the ingestion of 100g of pure glucose, 87ml of fat and 352 gr of grilled lean turkey.

The liquid form for glucose and fat makes them absorb very fast and thus exaggerate the insulin response.

The dry lean turkey is hard to eat without any sauce or anything to help mastication.  In addition digestion will be affected by the ingestion of the water which dilutes the digestion enzymes.  This is not applicable to the glucose meal.

The recent Western dietary change, mainly the massive increase in refined carbohydrate consumption, has well described adverse health consequences. Traits not under medical competence but still with large social importance seem also impacted, such as facial attractiveness. Facial attractiveness, an important factor of social interactions, seems to be impacted by immediate and chronic refined carbohydrate consumption. Further studies are needed to investigate how diet effects are mediated and which other social traits could be affected by refined carbohydrate consumption.

TL;DR: The keto diet may make people more attractive because it avoids both hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia because it provides relatively flat, steady blood sugar levels, compared to the typical high-carb diet. (my interpretation)",JohnNelson2022

The problem with anyone who doesn't care to look into it is they want to stick to their believe of being in ketosis while on a high protein diet.  Shawn Baker himself announced on twitter to lower his protein and increase the fat to be in higher ketosis to fix an inflammatory situation.

A misconception is that they believe turning protein into glucose would increase their blood glucose level thus no change in blood glucose level means there's no turnover of protein in glucose.  As you'll be able to read in the first link and second link, protein is converted to glycogen in the liver.

Somehow these people want to defend the demand driven aspect because they think if it is supply driven then it is somehow a negative thing.  There is nothing negative about it as far as I'm concerned except that some of that expensive meat is a costly way to create glucose.  But that is an artifact of our society, not of our evolution where you only had to pay for protein by hunting for it which was the same for getting the fat.

How much protein will take you out of ketosis?  That will be very contextual.  How much exercise do you perform that would consume the glycogen?  How much fat do you eat within your meals?  Your body mass and composition vs the amount of meat you eat etc.  How much protein synthesis are you able to stimulate?  How devoid of glycogen is your liver currently?

This will all cause variation in your personal result but there will always be some proportion converted to glycogen, and thus glucose, with every meal.",Ricosss

Carbs are protein sparing... in so much as the if the bodies requirements for glucose are met by carbs, the body won't need to convert protein into glucose. 

However, if you are metabolically healthy and have a low or zero carb diet ""too much"" protein is unlikely to ""kick you out"" of ketosis as your body is not going to convert the excess protein into glucose to the extent glucose isn't required to meet demand. Converting protein to glucose is metabolically costly for the body, so it would ideally prefer to take the path of least resistance. 

What excess protein will do however is lower your ketone levels. This is partly because the ""too much"" protein is converted into a circulating amino acid pool which is available as required for both metabolic uses and glucose production. This will in turn decrease (but not eliminate) the requirements for ketones. 

I don't measure my ketones, but if I did right now they would be fairly low, maybe 0.5 mmol/l. If I wanted to get my ketones higher, I would either need to fast for a few days or increase fat and drop protein & carbs way down for quite a while, maybe a week (not sure haven't tried). 

The reason being, I feel better eating 30 - 40% of my calories as protein. So to run down my amino acid pool takes some time, since my body is still processing my last meal, then using the amino acid pool as a savings bank. From my experience with extended fasting, it takes about 48 - 72 hours before my ketones start drifting sharply upwards. They might be: 0 hours 0.5mmol, 24 hours 0.7mmol, 48 hours 1 mmol, 72 hours 1.4 mmol.",volcus

I've been also thinking lately about gluconeogenic proteins in diet not without having the Bart Kay opinion on that. There are definitely amino-acids that scientists call glucogenic and ketogenic. And I generally can't see a problem for a body to use the resources it gets to get more energy. I don't know of any mechanism that converts proteins to fats. And considering that ketone bodies are made of fat and fat is a superior form of energy to store, then why wouldn't our bodies want to spare fats for using proteins as glucose that also can replete muscle glycogen stores.

Bart Kay generally calls out many people by saying that we aren't supposed to be in ketosis 24/7, and that insulin is required for normal body functions.

Also the lack of evidence and studies on those following a keto diet long enough and consistent enough to get real data from.

What would be great is a study that test groups of people who have been following keto for a long time vs people who have not. Each group is divided in three, high protein, adequate protein, low protein to see the effects. My understanding is that on very low carb diets GNG runs pretty consistently to make up for the lack of dietary glucose (is this true?) and testing varying levels of protein in both keto and non keto dieters would hopefully help separate the rate of GNG happening from lack of dietary glucose (demand) vs the GNG happening because the body doesn't know what to do with excess amino acids (supply). Apologies of this exists already, I have not seen one but would love to read it if anyone has it 

Higher protein intake affects the production of ketones, I don't even think that's controversial to say even at r/keto. But can it actually halt ketogenesis in the same way that consuming glucose can or does it just temporarily reduce it?

Will eating ""high"" protein actually prevent you from entering ketosis completely even in the absence of dietary carbs? Or does it just reduce circulating ketones?

I also struggle with determining what ""excess protein"" actually means, what amount is considered ""excess"" and is it even a practical level of intake? Why does the body override the regulation of GNG and use that ""excess"" to create unessary glucose rather than using it for anything else, or does it only do this if 100% of other uses for amino acids are satisfied?",BecauseImYourFather

Every meal that contains protein will trigger insulin and glucagon which puts everything at work to store at least some of that protein as glycogen.  After the meal, the degree to which there is liver glycogen will be the main determinant for the insulin level and that insulin level regulates how much lipolysis is going on and how the enzymes in the liver are expressed to produce either cholesterol or ketones.  Glucagon also has a role to play in this but is expected to be influenced by the level of insulin when we're back to a fasted state.

Not eating and performing exercise will reduce the liver glycogen level so insulin will follow by lowering and ketones will rise to protect from protein catabolism.",Ricosss

Demand is demand - I've been in ketosis for 5 - 6 years and I'm pretty much always in ketosis even though my carb intake varies wildly. I speculate that certain metabolic machinery just runs on ketones as a default after a while. 

The red blood cells, some cells in the kidneys, brain & testes will always require glucose. I've seen figures of a minimum required per day of 130g, although I suspect for me it is higher as I'm 194cm. 

If I don't eat any protein for a few days, my body will respond by upregulating ketones and fatty acids for fuel, and switch to producing glucose from fat. HGH will rise, preserving bodily protein stores. So my blood ketones will go up. 

If I start eating protein again, my body will switch from using fat as fuel to using more protein - both as required to the extent it is available, and as demanded.

Does protein intake simply down regulate ketogenesis or does it actually halt it all together to the point where if you continue to eat protein you would just never enter ketosis? If that's true the body would have to generate massive amounts of glucose in order to meet its demand.

Which excess is that?

If we have liver glycogen, the liver will downregulate gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. Why would the liver produce glucose from protein, when it can break down glycogen for glucose? Bit of a cart before the horse dilemma, wouldn't you say?

Have you heard the expression that ketones are glucose sparing? Why might we spare the use of glucose?

GNG is a demand driven process. As our body requires glucose, it is produced de novo. Because, as I have said ad nauseum, it is metabolically costly to do so from protein.

Perhaps in some people who are constantly zero carb, you may see a small repletion in liver glycogen before seeing a compensatory down regulation in gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. Which leads to a breakdown in that glycogen. And on we go.

I think your assumption wrong, I mean pancreas hormones control what our liver should do. Insulin says to all body that it is fed, that it should get nutrients from the food and to store the excess. You yourself put the cart before the horse.

>Well yeah, as liver glycogen. That's basic biology.

Are you a biochemist to say that outright?)

You could have done a basic search for ""how does glycogen affect gluconeogenesis"" and you would straight away see articles describing how the liver first depletes glycogen before initiating the production of glucose de novo. 

What information do we now have? :-

1. The de novo cost of gluconeogenesis is 33% of the energy content of the produced glucose
2. Minimum required glucose per day is 130g for the red blood cells etc
3. The body also requires 0.8g/kg of protein for basic physiology
4. The liver won't initiate gluconeogenesis in the presence of liver glycogen

So we are going to need a lot of protein for there to be an ""excess"" and if there is one, gluconeogenesis will be downregulated if glycogen stores start forming. Glycogen levels would be nothing like the kind of glycogen you'd get from eating carbs, simply because the liver would shut off gluconeogenesis once glycogen got to a certain point. 

I think if I was a much smaller guy and ate as much protein as I do, my ketones would be very minimal. Given I'm a big guy and my body seems hungry for protein, I can remain in a moderate level of ketosis despite eating a lot of protein. These things are always context dependant.",volcus

I haven't seen any strong evidence in that study that 33% of energy was gotten out of amino-acids, they didn't measure liver glycogen level even, where the other big amount of energy just were left for future use.

There is no correlation at all between gluconeogenesis and level of liver glycogen stores. Diabetics are always in gluconeogenesis mode, yet their liver glycogen are full. Hormones tell what the liver supposed to do, not the amount of storage. The amount of storage produces effect surely in adipose tissue that create HORMONE called leptin to tell the body about it.

You're using an example for people who have broken metabolism, to say this is how metabolism """"should"" work or how you would like it to work?

Look, to make glucose, the body needs glucagon to stimulate liver production, right? And the insulin to glucagon ratio would need to favour glucagon for gluconeogenesis.

You haven't demonstrated at all that the liver will store glycogen from gluconeogenesis, you've just asserted you would like it if that happened. You haven't acknowledged the simple fact that liver glycogen status is the driving factor which determines whether or not ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis even takes place in the first instance. Nor the simple fact that glucagon acts to break down glycogen, and that glucagon is required for gluconeogenesis. 

The only thing of any substance you have said is that type 2 diabetics have run away blood sugar from gluconeogenesis, while ignoring that they also have rampant and uncontrolled insulin, the literal hallmark of their condition.

Surely on a carbohydrate rich diet your liver is having good amounts of glycogen, not just because of carbohydrates, but also because of big insulin responces that carbs do to us.

Insulin provide glucose and amino-acids to cells, decreasing the sugar lever, that's one point.

ketoscience,Enteric and systemic postprandial lactate shuttle phases and dietary carbohydrate carbon flow in humans (Feb 2024),https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-024-00993-1,3,1,"Abstract:
>Dietary glucose in excess is stored in the liver in the form of glycogen. As opposed to direct conversion of glucose into glycogen, the hypothesis of the postprandial lactate shuttle (PLS) proposes that dietary glucose uptake is metabolized to lactate in the gut, thereby being transferred to the liver for glycogen storage. In the present study, we provide evidence of a PLS in young healthy men and women. Overnight fasted participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, and arterialized lactate concentration and rate of appearance were determined. The concentration of lactate in the blood rose before the concentration of glucose, thus providing evidence of an enteric PLS. Secondary increments in the concentration of lactate in the blood and its rate of appearance coincided with those of glucose, which indicates the presence of a larger, secondary, systemic PLS phase driven by hepatic glucose release. The present study challenges the notion that lactate production is the result of hypoxia in skeletal muscles, because our work indicates that glycolysis proceeds to lactate in fully aerobic tissues and dietary carbohydrate is processed via lactate shuttling. Our study proposes that, in humans, lactate is a major vehicle for carbohydrate carbon distribution and metabolism.",basmwklz

**Context**

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) are increased in type 2 diabetes and are potential regulators of metabolism. The effect of changes in caloric intake and macronutrient composition on their circulating levels in patients with type 2 diabetes are unknown.

**Objective**

To explore the effects of a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein diet with and without a clinically significant weight loss on circulating levels of FGF21 and GDF15 in patients with type 2 diabetes.

**Methods**

We measured circulating FGF21 and GDF15 in patients with type 2 diabetes who completed 2 previously published diet interventions. Study 1 randomized 28 subjects to an isocaloric diet in a 6 + 6-week crossover trial consisting of, in random order, a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) or a conventional diabetes (CD) diet. Study 2 randomized 72 subjects to a 6-week hypocaloric diet aiming at a ∼6% weight loss induced by either a CRHP or a CD diet. Fasting plasma FGF21 and GDF15 were measured before and after the interventions in a subset of samples (n = 24 in study 1, n = 66 in study 2).

**Results**

Plasma levels of FGF21 were reduced by 54% in the isocaloric study (P < .05) and 18% in the hypocaloric study (P < .05) in CRHP-treated individuals only. Circulating GDF15 levels increased by 18% (P < .05) following weight loss in combination with a CRHP diet but only in those treated with metformin.

**Conclusion**

The CRHP diet significantly reduced FGF21 in people with type 2 diabetes independent of weight loss, supporting the role of FGF21 as a “nutrient sensor.” Combining metformin treatment with carbohydrate restriction and weight loss may provide additional metabolic improvements due to the rise in circulating GDF15.",basmwklz

Since Jan 5th, I've lost 15lbs (181-166), I'm gaining muscle, I'm more limber (can touch my ear to my leg), I'm sleeping, less headaches, no heartburn, more energy than my adult children.

I've lived most of my life in Northern Michigan. Stuff like rabbit starvation is common knowledge here. If you get stranded in the wild everything your body NEEDS is in the meat and fat. Rabbit and venison are very lean. They can cause a person to starve with a full stomach. Eating only plants can cause a person to die of malnutrition while obese. We know this. So why do we let cereal companies convince us to eat insoluble fiber (no nutritional value), sugar (no nutritional value), seed oils (no nutritional value), artificial sweeteners, chemical colorings, chemical flavorings, preservatives, etc.

ketoscience,Proline restores mitochondrial function and reverses aging hallmarks in senescent cells (Feb 2024),https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)00066-4,18,1,"**Highlights**

    •Senescent MSCs exhibit reduced PYCR1 and PYCR2 expression

    •Proline induces Parkin-mediated mitophagy leading to improved mitochondrial function

    •Proline ameliorates several aging hallmarks, including SA-β-Gal and DNA damage

    •Proline improves myogenic differentiation capacity of senescent MSCs

**Summary**

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cellular senescence, with the loss of mitochondrial function identified as a potential causal factor contributing to senescence-associated decline in cellular functions. Our recent findings revealed that ectopic expression of the pluripotency transcription factor NANOG rejuvenates dysfunctional mitochondria of senescent cells by rewiring metabolic pathways. In this study, we report that NANOG restores the expression of key enzymes, PYCR1 and PYCR2, in the proline biosynthesis pathway. Additionally, senescent mesenchymal stem cells manifest severe mitochondrial respiratory impairment, which is alleviated through proline supplementation. Proline induces mitophagy by activating AMP-activated protein kinase α and upregulating Parkin expression, enhancing mitochondrial clearance and ultimately restoring cell metabolism. Notably, proline treatment also mitigates several aging hallmarks, including DNA damage, senescence-associated β-galactosidase, inflammatory cytokine expressions, and impaired myogenic differentiation capacity. Overall, this study highlights the role of proline in mitophagy and its potential in reversing senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and aging hallmarks.",basmwklz

When I wrote my last [blog](https://designedbynature.design.blog/2024/02/14/the-misunderstanding-and-miscalculation-of-fat-and-carbohydrate-oxidation-rates/) I had to delve deep into the chemistry.  It may be obvious for anyone with a chemistry degree but it made me realize how a lot of the reactions are there to handle the excess in hydrogen and how to eliminate hydrogen from the body.  Our body can't do anything with it although there is some functionality from the resulting water production.  In the TCA cycle almost each step involves dehydrogenase enzymes to get rid of the hydrogen atoms.

I wonder if there are reverse actions whereby the oxygen atom from water (H2O) is reused.  But in that case what happens to the 2 hydrogen atoms?  Absorbed in the bicarbonate buffer?  I don't see any other way to dispose hydrogen than via sweat and urine so ultimately it has to convert back to water.",Ricosss
